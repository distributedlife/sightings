<p>The <b>Yellow-collared Lovebird</b> (<i>Agapornis personatus</i>), also called <b>Masked Lovebird</b> or <b>Eye Ring Lovebird</b>, is a monotypic species of <span>bird</span> of the <span>lovebird</span> genus in the <span>parrot</span> family <span>Psittaculidae</span>. They are native to northeast <span>Tanzania</span> and have been introduced to Burundi and Kenya.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-collared Lovebird is a mainly green small parrot about 14.5&#xA0;cm (5.5&#xA0;in) long. Its upper parts are a darker green than its lower surfaces. Its head is black, and it has a bright red beak and white eyerings. Yellow on the breast is continuous with a yellow collar and an expansion of yellow over the nape of the neck. Male and female have identical external appearance.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-collared Lovebird brings nesting material in its beak to a tree cavity for their nest. The eggs are white and there are usually four to five in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 23 days and the chicks leave the nest about 42 days after hatching.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Housing">Housing</span></h3>
<p>White eye-rings lovebirds, of which <b>Masked Lovebirds</b> are part of, are reportedly less aggressive in comparison to the slightly larger <span>Peach-faced lovebird</span>. They are frequently housed in aviaries with other species of their <span>genus</span>, a practice which although can be convenient, &amp; wonderfully <span>aesthetic</span>, may lead to <span>hybridization</span>. This can especially be concerning where other species may not be as locally common e.g. <span>Black-cheeked Lovebird</span>, &amp; <span>Lilian's Lovebird</span>. It would be advisable to house <span>Lovebirds</span> either; by themselves, or if a mixed collection is desired, ensure they are kept in a large flight with a few feeding stations, &amp; assertive species e.g. <span>Red-rumped Parrot</span>, <span>K&#x101;k&#x101;riki</span>, <span>Rose-ringed Parakeet</span> or <span>Cockatiels</span>. They can usually be kept safely with <span>Quails</span>, &amp; <span>Pheasants</span> in aviaries.</p>
<p>Breeding cages should be 400mm x 400mm x 500mm, or these birds can be housed in <b>colonies</b>, or have in some cases been <i>kept at liberty</i>. There was a mixed flock of Masked, <span>Peach-faced Lovebird</span>, &amp; a few <span>hybrids</span> near Napier, <span>New Zealand</span> for a number of years in the mid 2000s. There is also a small feral population in France, which contains the Blue mutant, &amp; mixes with larger proportion of <span>Fischer's Lovebirds</span> - also from aviary origin.</p>
<p>Aviaries, &amp; cages need perches in a range of diameters. Natural perches in the form of branches are ideal, especially if they have a variety of forks, angles, &amp; a bit of bounce in them. The reason for this is to give the captives stimuli; it also keeps their feet healthy, &amp; nimble. Research (suitability, &amp; toxicity) must be carried out on all plant material going into any cages. Cherry wood is poisonous, as is Broom, <span>Kowhai</span>, &amp; everything Avocado (its fruit being surprisingly poisonous to parrots), to mention just a few examples.</p>
<p>Nesting boxes are usually utilised throughout the year as sleeping quarters. It is advisable to clean them, but keep them up even after breeding season. The risk of losing a bird to egg laying complications (in the unlikely event they do decide to breed in the winter), is out-weighed by the benefit of keeping the birds content, keeping pair-bonds strong, &amp; the reduced risk of losing a bird to the cold. A supply of <span>Willow</span> branches, &amp; roughly slivered <span>Corn</span>, or <span>Maize</span> husk can be given in the aviary as nesting box lining: It will be ripped up, &amp; carried into the nest box by the female.</p>
<p>Lovebirds are reasonably difficult to determine the sex of. A "pair" will often be of the same gender, even though they are exhibiting signs of mutual affection. This usually arises when inexperienced bird keepers house two birds alone, &amp; wait on behavioral signs that they're a <i>true pair</i>, with the intention of swapping one out for another Lovebird if they're not; then being excited when they see birds <i>pair up</i>, even though they may both be of the same sex. These bonds are artificial, &amp; can be broken, or tested if the "pair" are re-housed communally (or split up by the keeper). One or both of a pair of males may go, &amp; breed with lone hens, despite staying connected to their original partner. Or the same sex pair's bond may completely dissolve immediately.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Colour_varieties">Colour varieties</span></h3>
<p>The blue mutation was originally found in wild birds in the 1920s and is the oldest colour mutation known in the lovebird genus. The other mutations are a result of selective breeding in aviculture, such as two cobalts which will make a mauve (black). Various color mutations exist, including blue, cobalt, mauve, slate, dilute slate, violet, lutino (ino) and albino.</p>
<p>The <b>Blue</b> &amp; the <b>Lutino</b> <span>mutations</span> are where some colour <span>genes</span> have not been passed on, or have been suppressed from the original wild colour form. In the case of the <b>lutino</b> the micro-structure which creates the blue based colours in the normal form is not passed on to offspring when it arises; hence everywhere yellow except the face which contained the colours which make up orange. In the case of the original <b>Blue</b>, none of the yellow or red pigment genes are passed on. The <b><span>Albino</span></b> is the latest "colour" which is a combination of the <b>Lutino</b>, &amp; the <b>Blue</b> ('wild' colouring minus blue, &amp; minus red &amp; yellow = no colour so is completely white).</p>
<p>The <b>Dilute</b> <span>mutation</span> is a lightening of the darker feathers, most noticeable in the wings, &amp; face. It was first noted from Green (Wild) coloured parents, &amp; originally called <i>"Yellow"</i>. This new colour was soon built up in numbers by passionate aviculturelists, &amp; once secure was bred to <b>Blue</b> coloured birds. The result was then known as <i>"White"</i>, but we now call this combo a <b>Dilute Blue</b>.</p>
