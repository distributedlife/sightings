<p><b>Arnot's chat</b> (<i>Myrmecocichla arnotti</i>), also called the <b>white-headed black-chat</b>, is a species of <span>bird</span> in the chat and flycatcher family <span>Muscicapidae</span>. The species is found in southern Africa from <span>Rwanda</span> and <span>Angola</span> to <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The species was described by <span>Henry Baker Tristram</span> in 1869 based upon a specimen collected at <span>Victoria Falls</span> in modern-day <span>Zimbabwe</span>, as <i>Saxicola arnotti</i>. Tristram wrote that he named the species after the collector, a Mr. Arnott, but the man was actually named David Arnot. For this reason, it was suggested in 1965 that the name should be spelled <i>arnoti</i> instead. However, since there is no evidence in Tristram's original paper that the name was misspelled, the rules of the <span>International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</span> mandate that the spelling <i>arnotti</i> be maintained.</p>
<p>Along with the <span>white-fronted black-chat</span> this species is sometimes separated into the genus <i>Pentholaea</i>. The species contains two subspecies, <i>hartertii</i>, which is found in Angola, and the nominate, which is found across the rest of its range. A third subspecies, <i>collariis</i>, is now usually considered a separate species, the <span>Ruaha chat</span>. This species is indistinguishable from Arnot's chat in male birds but has different <span>plumage</span> in females, a difference that has mostly been overlooked for over a century.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Arnot's chat is most commonly found in healthy stands of <span>miombo</span> and <span>mopane</span> woodland. It also occurs at lower densities in other kinds of open woodland with little herbaceous cover, and very rarely near buildings. It generally occurs from sea level to 1,500&#xA0;m (4,900&#xA0;ft). The species is generally not <span>migratory</span>, but is presumed to undertake some localized wandering.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Arnot's chat ranges in size from 16&#x2013;18&#xA0;cm (6.3&#x2013;7.1&#xA0;in) and weighs around 35&#xA0;g (1.2&#xA0;oz). The <span>plumage</span> of the adults is <span>sexually dimorphic</span>; the male of the nominate race is overall black with a white crown and a white patch on the <span>wing coverts</span>. The female is similar but with a black crown and a white (tipped with black) throat and neck. The bill and legs are black. Juvenile birds are like the adults but with white feather tips on the crown or throat instead of fuller white. The male of the race <i>harterti</i> has less extensive white on the wings and a mostly black head with a small area of white on the forehead and above the eye; the white throat of the female is also less extensive than on the nominate.</p>
