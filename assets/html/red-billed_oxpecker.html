<p>The <b>red-billed oxpecker</b> (<i>Buphagus erythrorhynchus</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>starling</span> and <span>myna</span> family Sturnidae; some <span>ornithologists</span> regard the oxpeckers to be in a family by themselves, the Buphagidae. It is native to the savannah of sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>, from the <span>Central African Republic</span> east to <span>Sudan</span> and south to northern and eastern <span>South Africa</span>. Its range overlaps that of the less widespread <span>yellow-billed oxpecker</span>.</p>

<p>The red-billed oxpecker nests in tree holes lined with hair plucked from <span>livestock</span>. It lays 2-5 <span>eggs</span>, with three being the average. Outside the breeding season it forms large, chattering <span>flocks</span>.</p>

The red-billed oxpecker feeds on ticks found on other animals such as this <span>Impala</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The preferred habitat is open country, and the red-billed oxpecker eats <span>insects</span>. Both the <span>English</span> and scientific names arise from this species' habit of perching on large wild and domesticated <span>mammals</span> such as <span>cattle</span> and eating <span>ticks</span>. An adult will take nearly 100 engorged female <i>Boophilus decoloratus</i> ticks, or more than 12,000 <span>larvae</span> in a day.</p>
<p>However, their preferred food is blood, and while they may take ticks bloated with blood, they also feed on it directly, pecking at the mammal's wounds to keep them open to more parasites.</p>
<p>This is a medium-sized <span>passerine</span>, 20&#xA0;cm long with strong feet. The red-billed oxpecker has plain brown upperparts and head, buff underparts and a pale rump. The bill is red, and adults have a yellow eyering, both clear distinctions from the related <span>yellow-billed oxpecker</span>. Its flight is strong and direct, and the call is a hissy crackling <i>trik-quisss</i>.</p>
