<p>The <b>European Turtle Dove</b> (<i>Streptopelia turtur</i>), also known as the <b>Turtle Dove</b>, is a member of the <span>bird</span> family <span>Columbidae</span>, the doves and pigeons.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_status">Distribution and status</span></h2>
<p>The European Turtle Dove is a <span>migratory</span> species with a southern <span>Palearctic</span> range, including <span>Turkey</span> and <span>north Africa</span>, although it is rare in northern <span>Scandinavia</span> and <span>Russia</span>. It winters in <span>southern Africa</span>.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Countries including Afghanistan; Albania; Algeria; Andorra; Armenia; Austria; Azerbaijan; Bahrain; Belarus; Belgium; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Bulgaria; Burkina Faso; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Chad; China; Croatia; Cyprus; Czech Republic; Denmark; Egypt; Eritrea; Estonia; Ethiopia; Faroe Islands; Finland; France; Gabon; Gambia; Georgia; Germany; Ghana; Gibraltar; Greece; Guinea; Guinea-Bissau; Hungary; Iran; Iraq; Ireland; Israel; Italy; Jordan; Kazakhstan; Kuwait; Kyrgyzstan; Latvia; Lebanon; Libya; Liechtenstein; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Macedonia, the Republic of; Mali; Malta; Mauritania; Moldova; Mongolia; Montenegro; Morocco; Netherlands; Niger; Nigeria; Oman; Palestinian Territory; Poland; Portugal; Qatar; Romania; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia; Senegal; Serbia; Sierra Leone; Slovakia; Slovenia; Somalia; South Sudan; Spain; Sudan; Sweden; Switzerland; Syrian Arab Republic; Tajikistan; Togo; Tunisia; Turkey; Turkmenistan; Ukraine; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; Uzbekistan; Western Sahara; Yemen.</p>
<p>According to the State of Europe's <i>Common Birds 2007</i> report, the European Turtle Dove population in <span>Europe</span> has fallen by 62% in recent times. This is partly because changed farming practices mean that the weed seeds and shoots on which it feeds, especially <span>fumitory</span>, are more scarce, and partly due to shooting of birds in <span>Mediterranean</span> countries during their migration.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Smaller and slighter in build than many other <span>doves</span>, it measures 24&#x2013;29&#xA0;cm (9.4&#x2013;11.4&#xA0;in) in length, 47&#x2013;55&#xA0;cm (19&#x2013;22&#xA0;in) in wingspan and weighs 85&#x2013;170&#xA0;g (3.0&#x2013;6.0&#xA0;oz). the European Turtle Dove may be recognised by its browner colour, and the black-and-white-striped patch on the side of its neck. The tail is notable as the bird flies from the observer; it is wedge shaped, with a dark centre and white borders and tips. When viewed from below, this pattern, owing to the white under-tail coverts obscuring the dark bases, is a blackish chevron on a white ground. This can be seen when the bird stoops to drink and raises its spread tail.</p>

<p>The mature bird has the head, neck, flanks, and rump blue grey, and the wings cinnamon, mottled with black. The breast is vinaceous, the abdomen and under tail coverts are white. The bill is black, the legs and eye rims are red. The black and white patch on the side of the neck is absent in the browner and duller juvenile bird, which also has the legs brown.</p>
<p>The European Turtle Dove, one of the latest migrants, rarely appears in Northern Europe before the end of April, returning south again in September.</p>
<p>It is a bird of open rather than dense woodlands, and frequently feeds on the ground. It will occasionally nest in large gardens, but is usually extremely timid, probably due to the heavy hunting pressure it faces during migration. The flight is often described as arrowy, but is not remarkably swift.</p>
<p>The nuptial flight, high and circling, is like that of the <span>Common Wood Pigeon</span>, but the undulations are less decided; it is accompanied by the whip-crack of the downward flicked wings. The arrival in spring is heralded by its <span>purring</span> song, a rather deep, vibrating &#x201C;turrr, turrr&#x201D;, from which the bird's name is derived. Despite the identical spelling, the "turtle" of the name, derived from Latin <i>turtur</i>, has no connection with the reptile; "turtle" in that case came originally from <span>Late Latin</span> <i>tortuca</i>.</p>
<p>A few other doves in the same genus are also called 'turtle doves':</p>

<i>The Turtle Dove</i> by <span>Sophie Gengembre Anderson</span>.</div>

<p>Perhaps because of Biblical references (especially the well-known verse from the <span>Song of Songs</span>), its mournful voice, and the fact that it forms strong <span>pair bonds</span>, European Turtle Doves have become emblems of devoted love. In the <span>New Testament</span>, two turtle doves are mentioned to have been sacrificed for the <span>Birth of Jesus</span>. In Renaissance Europe, the European Turtle Dove was envisaged as the devoted partner of the <span>Phoenix</span>. <span>Robert Chester</span>'s poem <i>Love's Martyr</i> is a sustained exploration of this symbolism. It was published along with other poems on the subject, including <span>William Shakespeare</span>'s poem "<span>The Phoenix and the Turtle</span>" (where "turtle" refers to the turtle dove).</p>
<p>The Turtle Dove is featured in a number of <span>folk songs</span> about love and loss. One of these is a setting by <span>Ralph Vaughan Williams</span>.</p>
<p>Turtle Doves also are featured in the song, "<span>The Twelve Days of Christmas</span>", as the gift "my true love gives to me" on the second day of Christmas. If added cumulatively, by the end of the song, the recipient has been given 22.</p>
<p>Turtle doves appear in the title and lyrics of a <span>spiritual</span> from the Georgia <span>Sea Islands</span>.</p>
<p>In the <span>Shaker</span> hymn "In Yonder Valley", it is seen as a good omen and sign of growth that "The Turtledove is in our land".</p>
