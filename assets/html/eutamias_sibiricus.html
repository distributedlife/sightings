<p>The <b>Siberian chipmunk</b> or <b>common chipmunk</b> (<i>Eutamias sibiricus</i>) appears across northern <span>Asia</span> from central <span>Russia</span> to <span>China</span>, <span>Korea</span>, and <span>Hokkaid&#x14D;</span> in northern <span>Japan</span>. The Siberian <span>chipmunk</span> was imported from <span>South Korea</span> and introduced in <span>Europe</span> as a pet in the 1960s. It is the only chipmunk found outside <span>North America</span>, and this animal is classed either as the only living member of the genus <i><span>Eutamias</span></i>, or as a member of a genus including all chipmunks.</p>

<p>Although these animals can exhibit slight variations in coloration in different geographic regions, they possess several common characteristics. Typically the Siberian chipmunk has 4 white stripes and 5 dark stripes along the back. It is 18&#x2013;25&#xA0;cm long, a third of which is the tail. The weight of adults depends on the time of year and food availability. Even though the Siberian chipmunk normally grows to 50&#x2013;150&#xA0;grams, this species is relatively small compared to other <span>Sciuridae</span>, such as the <span>Red Squirrel</span>.  The Siberian chipmunks are not known to exhibit <span>sexual dimorphism</span>, and size and body proportions are the only way to distinguish younger chipmunks from older ones. Their small size may contribute to their relatively short lives, which tend to range from 2 to 5 years in the wild. However, when placed in <span>captivity</span>, as seen in Europe in the 1960's, they have the potential to live anywhere from 6 to 10 years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>Siberian chipmunks were found only in their native range of Eastern Asia until the 1960s, when this species was introduced to European countries. During the 1960s, South Korea began to export these animals to Europe as a part of the pet trade. Between 1960 and 1980, South Korea exported more than 200,000 individuals to Europe. Human introduction is a major risk for the spread of this species into other forests and areas. By the 1970's, the Siberian chipmunk inhabited suburban forests and urban parks in <span>Belgium</span>, <span>France</span>, <span>Switzerland</span>, <span>Germany</span>, <span>Italy</span>, the <span>Netherlands</span>, and <span>Austria</span>.  Owners released these animals because they no longer wanted them as pets, or the owners purposefully freed the chipmunks to live naturally in the wild. Other Siberian chipmunks escaped from <span>captivity</span> and inhabited the forested areas of Europe.  While thousands of animals were introduced to new environments, their naturally slow spreading, 200 to 250 meters per year, prevented them from rapidly moving to areas beyond Europe.</p>

<p>The Siberian chipmunk can survive in a variety of <span>habitats</span> and conditions. They are usually found in <span>coniferous forests</span>, stony areas within <span>forests</span> and <span>mountains</span>, habitats filled with <span>shrub</span>, along waterways or roads, or other small patches of agricultural land.  In Europe, the introduced populations usually live in <span>deciduous forests</span>, mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, or urban areas with greenery.  Tamias sibiricus is able to survive in various environmental conditions, anywhere from 29&#xB0;N to 69&#xB0;N and -65&#xB0;C to 30&#xB0;C. However, this species has a low ability of dispersal, and since they are mainly introduced into woody forests or urban areas with greenery, they have less potential to be naturally dispersed to other regions. Also they have trouble overcoming man-made and naturally occurring obstacles, like roads or <span>swamps</span>. </p>
<p>The Siberian chipmunk lives in loose colonies, where every individual has its own <span>territory</span>. The territory ranges from 700 to 4000&#xA0;m and is larger for females than males and is also larger in <span>autumn</span> than <span>spring</span>. The Siberian chipmunk <span>marks its territory with urine</span> and oral glands inside of its cheeks. This method illustrates one way in which this species communicates with one another. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Siberian chipmunks usually live solitary lives, but during the winter they create a <span>burrow</span>, which they often share with another chipmunk. Its burrow, which can be 2.5 m long and 1.5 m deep, consists of a nest chamber, several storage chambers and chambers for the waste. During this winter season, these chipmunks store 3-4 kg of food in order to survive underground until April or May. In addition to the pairing off during hibernation, they also use a complex voice communication system to interact. They have two vocal sounds, a fast, sharp sound for when they are frightened and a deep croak sound that is thought to be used for mating. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>While most chipmunks and squirrels are promiscuous in their mating routines, little is known about the mating habits of the Siberian chipmunk. It is known that they are <span>iteroparous</span>, <span>viviparous</span>,and their breeding season usually occurs after hibernation in mid April. They tend to breed only once or twice a year, and the number of offspring varies from 3 to 8. The young are born blind and naked, and they weigh between 3-5 grams. After the 28 to 35 day <span>gestation period</span>, the offspring open their eyes about 20 to 25 days after birth. The females are responsible for caring for the young, and they teach them how to <span>forage</span> around 6 weeks. Then the offspring complete the <span>weaning</span> stage around 7 weeks, and they reach the independent stage around 8 weeks.  Adult body mass is reached at around 3 to 4 months, and by 9 months, both the male and the female reach sexual maturity. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>Siberian chipmunks are <span>omnivores</span> that store or cache food.  Normally, they eat Siberian pine seeds, along with different deciduous and coniferous tree <span>seeds</span>. In addition to seeds, they eat herb <span>roots</span>, <span>insects</span>, <span>mollusks</span>, <span>birds</span>, <span>reptiles</span>, <span>grains</span>, <span>fruit</span>,and <span>fungus</span>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecosystem_roles">Ecosystem roles</span></h3>
<p>Siberian chipmunks are essential food sources for other animals, such as diurnal raptors, <span>weasels</span>, and small <span>cats</span>. Other known predators include <span>hawks</span>, <span>owls</span>, and <span>foxes</span>.  They evade being preyed upon by these animals by being alert, hiding in their burrows, and using their camouflaged fur to blend in with surroundings. They distribute seeds and fungal <span>spores</span>, and other animals feed off their stored food.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Positive_impacts">Positive impacts</span></h3>
<p>Siberian chipmunks disperse seeds and fungal spores, which help forests grow and regenerate. They also aid <span>species diversity</span> by helping control pests in its environment. In addition to the beneficial aspects for the <span>environment</span>, some humans keep Siberian chipmunks as pets or sell them for their fur or other body parts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Negative_impacts">Negative impacts</span></h3>
<p>The increasing rate of urbanization provides humans with greater mobility, and this advancement provides easier opportunities for humans to introduce non-native species, many of which cause health or economic issues.  For instance, Siberian chipmunks tend to eat crops and damage urban gardens. In Russia, they eat approximately 50 percent of the forest nuts, and in other locations they can produce economic setbacks in regards to grains and orchards because of large consumption of these products. These chipmunks are also known for preying upon low-nesting birds, and Siberian chipmunks often compete with other small native animals, such as the red squirrel, wood mouse, and bank vole. However the most concerning aspect of this species' influence revolves around its ability to carry diseases, like <span>Lyme disease</span>, that have the potential to create danger for humans and domestic animals.</p>

estimated contribution to Lyme disease comparison chart</div>

</div>
<p>Lyme disease, also known as <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, is a vector-borne disease that can be transmitted through ticks. In comparison to bank voles and <span>wood mice</span>, the Siberian chipmunks contribute a much larger risk when it comes to Lyme disease. The chipmunk's ability to spread this disease poses a risk to humans because Lyme disease can cause <span>neurological</span>, <span>joint</span>, and <span>skin</span> problems.  The <span>Invasive Species Compendium</span> states that the Siberian chipmunk can easily survive and spread diseases, like Lyme disease, to humans because the species has high genetic variability and high reproductive potential. Also, with the Siberian chipmunk's movement and introduction into new environments, ticks and other parasites possess a greater opportunity to attach to hosts.  Lastly species invasion is difficult and costly to control, so these animals will continue to pose a threat to humans and other animals until they eventually became <span>extinct</span> or until humans actively take measures to reduce their impact on society.</p>
