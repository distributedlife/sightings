<p>The <b>maned rat</b> or <b>crested rat</b> (<i>Lophiomys imhausi</i>) is a <span>nocturnal</span>, long-haired and bushy-tailed East <span>African</span> <span>rodent</span> that superficially resembles a <span>porcupine</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The maned rat's body can grow up to 14 inches (360&#xA0;mm) long, or 21 inches (530&#xA0;mm) from head to tail. The coat consists of long, silver and black-tipped guard hairs over a dense, woolly, grey and white undercoat, with the face and limbs having short, black fur. A mane of longer, coarser black-and-white banded hairs extends from the top of the animal's head to just beyond the base of the <span>tail</span>. This mane is bordered by a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin.</p>
<p>When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane erects and this strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this area are, at the tips, like ordinary hair, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent. The rat is known to deliberately smear these hairs with poison from the bark of the <i><span>Acokanthera schimperi</span></i>, on which it chews, thus creating a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill <span>predators</span> which attempt to bite it.</p>
<p><i>Lophiomys</i> differs from typical <span>Muridae</span> in having the <span>temporal fossa</span> roofed over a thin plate of bone, rudimentary clavicles, and an opposable hallux. On these grounds, it has been made the type of a family; its dentition, however, is typical <span>Cricetine</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>Its diet in the wild consists largely of leaves, <span>fruit</span>, and other plant material, but has been known to eat meat, cereals, root vegetables, and <span>insects</span> in captivity. Food is eaten by sitting on its haunches and using its forepaws to bring food items to its mouth.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The <span>habitat</span> of the maned rat <span>ranges</span> from nearly sea level, in Ethiopia and Somalia, to more typically the drier, highland forests and woodlands of Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. Fossil remains have been found as far north as Israel, however. They are often found in rocky areas or in hollow tree trunks and holes along the tops of ravines, and have also been found nesting among rocks on cliff-faces.</p>
