<p>The <b>white-breasted cormorant</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax lucidus</i>) is much like the widespread <span>great cormorant</span> and if not a regional variant of the same species, is at least very closely related. It is distinguished from other forms of the great cormorant by its white breast and by the fact that subpopulations are freshwater birds. <i>Phalacrocorax lucidus</i> is not to be confused with the smaller and very different endemic South Australian <span>black-faced cormorant</span>, which also is sometimes called the white-breasted cormorant.</p>

<p>The white-breasted cormorant (<i>Phalacrocorax lucidus</i>) is a member of the cormorant family <span>Phalacrocoracidae</span>. Its taxonomic status has been under discussion for some decades and several questions still have not been definitively settled. <i>Phalacrocorax lucidus</i> sometimes is treated as a <span>subspecies</span> of the <span>great cormorant</span>, <i>Phalacrocorax carbo lucidus</i>, but some authorities (e.g. Sibley &amp; Monroe, 1990, Sinclair, Hockey and Tarboton, 2002) retain its original treatment as an <span>allospecies</span> in the <i>P. carbo</i> superspecific group, in which case it is referred to as <i>Phalacrocorax lucidus</i>. A black-necked form originally classified as <i>Phalacrocorax patricki</i> or <i>Phalacrocorax carbo patricki</i> is now regarded as <span>synonymous</span> with <i>Phalacrocorax lucidus</i>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the 80&#x2013;100&#xA0;cm long white-breasted cormorant has a white neck and breast when adult, and the white area tends to increase as the bird becomes more mature. In other respects it is a large cormorant generally resembling the great cormorant.</p>
<p>The smaller and very different southern Australian <span>black-faced cormorant</span>, <i>Phalacrocorax fuscescens</i>, is also sometimes known as the white-breasted cormorant.</p>

<p>The white-breasted cormorant is the only form of great cormorant found in <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>, the only form that has strictly freshwater populations and the only form with a white breast and throat; it does however interbreed freely with dark-breasted forms in central Africa. It has a wide distribution; on the west coast from the <span>Cape Verde Islands</span> to <span>Guinea-Bissau</span> and from <span>Angola</span> to the <span>Cape of Good Hope</span> and northwards on the east coast to <span>Mozambique</span>. It occurs around the entire Southern African coastline, but it is not clear whether the coastal populations are separate from the inland populations. On the African mainland it occurs more frequently in eastern and southern parts, rather than in the drier western regions, where it usually is found only on perennial rivers and dams. On inland waters it commonly occurs together with the <span>reed cormorant</span> and the <span>African darter</span>, but it is ecologically separated from these species by its fishing habits and the size and nature of its prey. There are also inland populations in <span>Nigeria</span> and around <span>Lake Chad</span>, and in eastern and southern Africa from <span>Sudan</span> southwards. It can be found around the <span>Red Sea</span>, where it is sometimes referred to as the <b>Red Sea white-breasted cormorant</b>.</p>
