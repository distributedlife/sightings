<p>The <b>Lidth's jay</b> (<i>Garrulus lidthi</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Corvidae</span>, native to Japan.</p>
<p>Measuring up to 38&#xA0;cm (15&#xA0;in) in total length, it is slightly larger than its close relative the <span>Eurasian jay</span>, with a proportionately stouter bill and also a longer tail. It has no discernible crest, with the head <span>feathers</span> a velvety black, the shoulders and back a deep purplish blue and all other parts a rich chestnut purple.</p>
<p>This <span>jay</span> has a very restricted distribution occurring only on the southern <span>Japanese</span> islands of <span>Amami &#x14C;shima</span> and <span>Tokunoshima</span> in pine forest, sub-tropical woodland and cultivated areas especially around villages.</p>
<p>Food is largely made up of the <span>acorns</span> of the native <span>oak</span> <i>Quercus cuspidata</i> but includes small <span>reptiles</span> and <span>invertebrates</span> of many types.</p>
<p>The bird nests in large cavities in trees but otherwise the nest is the same as that of the other two <i>Garrulus</i> species with 3&#x2013;4 <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>The voice is similar to that of the <span>Eurasian jay</span>.</p>
<p>The species was threatened in the past by hunting for its <span>feathers</span>, which were used for decorating ladies' hats. Today it is threatened by <span>introduced</span> <span>small Indian mongooses</span>, which were brought to its range to control the venomous <span>Okinawa pit viper</span>. The species is fully protected under Japanese law and is increasing in numbers thanks to control of the mongooses.</p>
