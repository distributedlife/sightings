<p>The <b>Atlantic petrel</b> (<i>Pterodroma incerta</i>) is a <span>gadfly petrel</span> <span>endemic</span> to the South <span>Atlantic Ocean</span>. It breeds in enormous <span>colonies</span> on <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> and <span>Gough Island</span>, and ranges at sea from <span>Brazil</span> to <span>Namibia</span>, with most records at sea being to the west of the breeding islands, and along the subtropical convergence.</p>
<p>The species feeds mostly on <span>squid</span>, which comprises 87% of its diet in some studies; it will also feed on <span>lanternfishes</span> (Myctophidae) as they ascend to the surface at night, as well as on <span>crustaceans</span>.</p>
<p>Although the species exists in large numbers, the world population being estimated at around 5 million birds, the species is listed as vulnerable by the <span>IUCN</span>. The species is restricted to just two breeding islands and has declined historically due to exploitation for food, and is currently thought to be threatened by <span>introduced</span> <span>house mice</span>, which attack chicks leading to low breeding success.</p>
<p>It was formerly classified as a <span>vulnerable species</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. But new research has demonstrated the severe impact of predation by mice. Consequently, it was uplisted to <span>endangered</span> status in 2008.</p>
