<p><b>Thayer's gull</b> (<i>Larus thayeri</i>) is a large <span>gull</span> native to <span>North America</span> that breeds in the Arctic islands of <span>Canada</span> and winters primarily on the <span>Pacific</span> coast, from southern <span>Alaska</span> to the <span>Gulf of California</span>, though there are also wintering populations on the <span>Great Lakes</span> and the upper <span>Mississippi River</span>. The species has occurred as a vagrant to <span>Tamaulipas</span>, <span>Mexico</span>, <span>Japan</span>, <span>Denmark</span>, and other parts of western Europe.</p>
<p>Somewhat intermediate between <span>American herring gull</span> and <span>Iceland gull</span> in habit and appearance and at times considered conspecific with either species, the adult Thayer's hull in nonbreeding plumage has a pale gray mantle, with obvious blackish wingtips, and extensive brown streaking on the head and neck. The head, neck, breast, belly, and underwings are primarily white, and the legs are pink. There is a red spot on the lower mandible, and the color of the iris is generally dark. In summer, the head and neck are white, with the bill turning bright yellow with a larger red spot on the lower mandible. Juvenile gulls are brown, with black bills, and black legs which quickly fade to adult pink. Thayer's Gull reaches a length of 56 to 64&#xA0;cm (22 to 25&#xA0;in), with a wingspan of 130 to 148&#xA0;cm (51 to 58&#xA0;in) and a weight of approximately 720 to 1,500&#xA0;g (1.59 to 3.31&#xA0;lb). Males average around 1,093&#xA0;g (2.410&#xA0;lb) and females, being slightly smaller, average 900&#xA0;g (2.0&#xA0;lb). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 38.4 to 44.2&#xA0;cm (15.1 to 17.4&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 4.4 to 5.5&#xA0;cm (1.7 to 2.2&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 5.2 to 6.9&#xA0;cm (2.0 to 2.7&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>During winter, it is found in small numbers among mixed flocks of large gulls, though it may gather in large numbers in certain locations. In summer, it is found on the tundra of high Arctic islands. These gulls with lay 3 bluish or greenish eggs in nests lined with grass, moss or lichens. Their voice consists of mostly mewing and squealing notes.</p>
<p>There is continuing debate about the taxonomic status of this species, and some authorities consider Thayer's gull to be the dark-mantled form of Iceland gull, with <span>Kumlien's gull</span> (variously treated as a subspecies of either Thayer's or Iceland gulls) as an intermediate example, forming a <span>cline</span> rather than separate species. The <span>American Ornithologists' Union</span> considered Thayer's gull a subspecies of American herring gull from 1917 until 1973, when they determined it was a separate species from herring gull. While numerous papers have since been written suggesting downgrading this species to a subspecies or even a morph of Iceland gull, the AOU as well as all North American field guides continue to treat Thayer's gull as a separate species. The <span>British Ornithologists' Union</span> follows the publication <i>Birds of North America</i> in lumping the three as forms of Iceland gull.</p>
<p>Both the common and species names honor ornithologist <span>John Eliot Thayer</span>, and so the first part of its name is pronounced "THAY-erz".</p>
