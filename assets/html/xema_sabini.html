<p>The <b>Sabine's gull</b>  (<i>Xema sabini</i>), also known as the <b>fork-tailed gull</b> or <b>xeme</b>, is a small <span>gull</span>. Its generic placement is disputed; some authors treat it as the <span>sole species</span> in the genus <i>Xema</i> as <i><b>Xema sabini</b></i>, while others retain it in the genus <i><span>Larus</span></i> as <i><b>Larus sabini</b></i>. It breeds in the <span>Arctic</span> and has a circumpolar distribution through northernmost <span>North America</span> and <span>Eurasia</span>. It <span>migrates</span> south in autumn; most of the population winters at sea in the <span>Pacific</span> off western <span>South America</span> in the cold waters of the <span>Humboldt Current</span>, while <span>Greenland</span> and eastern Canadian <span>birds</span> cross the <span>Atlantic</span> by way of the westernmost fringes of <span>Europe</span> to winter off southwest <span>Africa</span> in the cold waters of the <span>Benguela Current</span>. Occasionally individual Sabine's gulls can be seen off other coasts such as the northeastern <span>United States</span> or further east in Europe, typically following autumn storms. It is recorded often enough inland in North America, Europe, and even Siberia, that it has been said to exhibit "cross-continental migration" in addition to migration at sea.</p>
<p>The Sabine's gull breeds in colonies on coasts and <span>tundra</span>, laying two or three spotted olive-brown <span>eggs</span> in a ground nest lined with <span>grass</span>. It is very pelagic outside the breeding season. It takes a wide variety of mainly animal food, and will eat any suitable small <span>prey</span>. It also steals eggs from nesting colonies of <span>Arctic terns</span>.</p>

<p>The Sabine's gull is a small gull, 27&#x2013;33&#xA0;cm (11&#x2013;13&#xA0;in) in length and weighing 135&#x2013;225&#xA0;g (4.8&#x2013;7.9&#xA0;oz). The wings are long, thin and pointed with a span of between 81&#x2013;87&#xA0;cm (32&#x2013;34&#xA0;in). The bill, which is black with a yellow tip, is around 2.5&#xA0;cm (0.98&#xA0;in) long.</p>
<p>This species is easy to identify through its striking wing pattern. The adult has a pale grey back and wing coverts, black primary flight feathers and white secondaries. The white tail is forked. The male's hood darkens during breeding season. Young birds have a similar tricoloured wing pattern, but the grey is replaced by brown, and the tail has a black terminal band. Juveniles take two years to attain full adult <span>plumage</span>. They have a very high-pitched and squeaking call.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_evolution">Taxonomy and evolution</span></h2>
<p>The Sabine's gull is usually treated as comprising a monotypic genus; it is only placed within the genus <i>Larus</i> when the genus is enlarged. The black <span>bill</span> and notched tail are almost unique within the gulls, as they are shared only with the <span>swallow-tailed gull</span> of the <span>Galapagos</span>. On the basis of this the two species were often thought to be each other's closest relatives, a hypothesis ruled out by a number of behaviour and ecological differences. Mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that they are not closely related, and the closest relative of the Sabine's gull is now thought to be the <span>ivory gull</span>, another Arctic species. The two species are thought to have separated around 2 million years ago, longer ago than most groups of gull species.</p>
<p>Geographical variation is slight; birds from Alaska are slightly darker and perhaps bigger. Most authorities recognise no races, but a few recognise four based on size and mantle (back) colour.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name">Name</span></h2>
<p>The specific epithet and common name honour the Irish scientist Sir <span>Edward Sabine</span>, who sent a specimen to his brother <span>Joseph Sabine</span>; Joseph referred to it as <i>Larus sabini</i> in 1818. (The first accepted description was by Leach in 1819.) The <i><span>Oxford English Dictionary</span></i> gives the pronunciation <span class="nowrap"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA"><span>/</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#x2C8;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>s</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#xE6;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>b</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>a&#x26A;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>n</span></span><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA"><span>/</span></span></span> <span title="English pronunciation respelling" class="Unicode"><span>SAB-yn</span></span>, which is the pronunciation of the surname according to a history of the Sabine family.
