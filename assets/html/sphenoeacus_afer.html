<p>The <b>Cape Grassbird</b> or <b>Cape Grass Warbler</b> (<i>Sphenoeacus afer</i>) is an <span>African warbler</span> found in southern Africa.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Formerly placed in the <span>Sylviidae</span> family, it is the only member of the genus <i>Sphenoeacus</i>. The taxonomy of the "African warblers", an assemblage of usually species-poor and apparently rather ancient "odd warblers" from Africa, is currently in a state of flux.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Grassbird is 17 to 19 centimetres (6.7 to 7.5&#xA0;in) long and weighs around 30 grams (1.1&#xA0;oz) Its crown and face sides are rufous, except for white around the eye, and it has black malar and moustachial stripes on its white throat. The upperparts are brown with heavy streaking and the long tail is a lighter brown while the underparts are whitish with blackish spotting. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile has a streaked cap and is duller than the adult. The song is jangling and musical, and the call is a nasal <i>pheeeo</i>.</p>
<p>The long, pointed, straggly tail, chestnut cap and facial stripes are diagnostic of Cape Grassbird. It is much larger than any <span>cisticola</span>, and the heavily streaked back and the pointed tail eliminate confusion with <span>Moustached Grass Warbler</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Grassbird breeds in southern Africa in <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Mozambique</span> and <span>Swaziland</span> with an isolated population in eastern <span>Zimbabwe</span>. It is a common species of coastal and mountain <span>fynbos</span> and long, rank grass on mountain slopes or in river valleys.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Grassbird builds a cup nest flow in vegetation. This species is monogamous, pairing for life. Its eggs have one of the slowest rates of embryonic development amongst Southern African species.</p>
<p>The Cape Grassbird is usually seen alone or in pairs, moving through vegetation foraging for insects and other small invertebrates.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 390,000 square kilometres (150,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as of Least Concern.</p>
