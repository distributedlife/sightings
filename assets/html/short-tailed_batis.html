<p>The <b>Forest Batis</b> or <b>Short-tailed Batis</b> (<i>Batis mixta</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>bird</span> in the <span>wattle-eye</span> family, Platysteiridae. It is found in tropical moist <span>forests</span> in southern <span>Kenya</span> and northern <span>Tanzania</span>. It mainly occurs in <span>montane forest</span> but in south-east Kenya it is found in lowland forest near the coast.</p>
<p>The <span>Dark Batis</span> (<i>B. crypta</i>) of south-west Tanzania and northern <span>Malawi</span> was formerly included in this species but was described a new separate species in 2006. <b>Reichenow's Batis</b> (<i>B. reichenowi</i>) of coastal south-east Tanzania is often treated as a <span>subspecies</span> of the <span>Cape Batis</span> (<i>B. capensis</i>) or as a species in its own right but may be a subspecies of the Forest Batis.</p>
