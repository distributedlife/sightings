<p>The <b>white-chinned petrel</b> or <b>Cape hen</b>, <i>Procellaria aequinoctialis</i>, is a large <span>shearwater</span> in the <span>family</span> <span>Procellariidae</span>. It ranges around the <span>Southern Ocean</span> as far north as southern <span>Australia</span>, <span>Peru</span> and <span>Namibia</span>, and breeds <span>colonially</span> on scattered islands.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The white-chinned petrel is a member of the <span>Procellaria</span> <span>genus</span>, and in turn is a member of the <span>Procellariidae</span> <span>family</span>, and the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>. As a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the petrel are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Procellaria</i> comes from two <span>Latin</span> words, <i>procella</i> "storm" and <i>arius</i> "pertaining to", with reference to the birds' association with stormy weather. The word <i>petrel</i> is derived from <span>Saint Peter</span> and the story of his walking on water, referring to their appearing to run on the water's surface when taking to the air.</p>

<p>The white-chinned petrel measures 51&#x2013;58&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;23&#xA0;in) in length, weighs 0.97&#x2013;1.89&#xA0;kg (2.1&#x2013;4.2&#xA0;lb) and spans 134&#x2013;147&#xA0;cm (53&#x2013;58&#xA0;in) across the wings. Not only is it the largest <i>Procellaria</i> petrel but is also the largest species in its <span>family</span> outside of the <span>giant petrels</span>. This large petrel is sooty-black and has some white on its throat and chin, more so in the Indian Ocean sector than the Atlantic. Its <span>primaries</span> can have a silvery appearance underneath. Its <span>bill</span> may be horn or yellow with a black tip, and also black between the nostrils. It has black feet. When it flies, it mixes slow wing beats with glides. Although normally quiet, it will rattle or groan while at its colony.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Their diet is composed mainly of <span>krill</span> followed by fish. White-chinned petrels feed by surface seizing and by undertaking shallow dives, and they will readily follow ships to collect fisheries discards, making them vulnerable to <span>longline</span> fisheries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Both sexes help to build a nest, and will help <span>incubate</span> the egg. Upon hatching, both sexes again will assist in feeding and protecting the young.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The white-chinned petrel utilises many islands during the breeding season. 2,000,000 pairs breed on <span>South Georgia</span>, Between 175,000 and 226,000 pairs are on the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, and 100,000 pairs on <span>Disappointment Island</span>. Some also breed on the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Prince Edward Islands</span>, <span>Campbell Islands</span>, <span>Auckland Islands</span>, <span>Antipodes Islands</span>, and the <span>Falkland Islands</span>. During the non-breeding season, the petrels fly from the <span>Antarctic</span> <span>pack ice</span> to the <span>subtropics</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>A 2004 estimate placed the adult population at 7,000,000 with an occurrence range of 44,800,000&#xA0;km (17,300,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). Mortality of both adults and chicks due to <span>longline</span> fisheries has caused the <span>IUCN</span> to classify it as <span>vulnerable</span>. An overall decline in population is inferred by a drop in <span>burrow</span> occupancy rates of 28% at <span>Bird Island</span>, and an 86% reduction in population at <span>Prydz Bay</span>. Also, monitoring on <span>Marion Island</span> has shown of 14.5% reduction, and a 37% reduction on the <span>Crozet Islands</span>. Unintentional death at the hands of longline fisheries has proven to be a major contributor to the overall population decline. Nearly all of the <span>bycatch</span> from the <span>Namibian</span> <span>hake</span> are white-chinned petrels. 10% of the <span>South African</span> <span>pelagic</span> longline bycatch and 55% of the <span>demersal</span>. Also, the white-chinned petrel has suffered at the hands of invasive species such as the <span>brown rat</span>, <i>Rattus novegicus</i>, and the <span>black rat</span>, <i>Rattus rattus</i>.</p>
<p>Several of the breeding islands are protected areas. Ongoing studies and population monitoring are occurring at <span>South Georgia</span>, the <span>Prince Edward Islands</span>, <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, and <span>Crozet Islands</span>. Finally, they are a part of <span>ACAP Annex I</span>, and <span>CMS Appendix II</span>.</p>
<p>To assist in reversing the decline in population it has been proposed to continue and extend monitoring studies, trying to eliminate most invasive species, promote adoption of best practice mitigation measures at all fisheries within the range via <span>ACAP</span>, <span>FAO</span>, <span>CCAMLR</span>.</p>
