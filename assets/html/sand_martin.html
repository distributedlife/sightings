<p>The <b>sand martin</b> (<i>Riparia riparia</i>) is a <span>migratory</span> <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>swallow</span> family. It has a wide <span>range</span> in summer, embracing practically the whole of <span>Europe</span> and the <span>Mediterranean</span> countries, part of northern <span>Asia</span> and also <span>North America</span>. It winters in eastern and southern <span>Africa</span>, <span>South America</span> and <span>South Asia</span>. It is known as <b>bank swallow</b> in North America, and as <b>collared sand martin</b> in South Asia, and sometimes as <b>European sand martin</b>.</p>

<p>The 12&#xA0;cm long sand martin is brown above, white below with a narrow brown band on the breast; the bill is black, the legs brown. The young have <span>rufous</span> tips to the <span>coverts</span> and margins to the secondaries.</p>
<p>Its brown back, white throat, small size and quick jerky flight separate it at once from similar swallows, such as the <span>house martin</span> (<i>Delichon urbicum</i>), the <span>cliff swallow</span> (<i>Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</i>) or other species of <i><span>Riparia</span></i>. Only the <span>banded martin</span> (<i>R. cincta</i>) of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> is similar, but the sand martin only occurs there in winter.</p>
<p>The <span>pale martin</span> of northern <span>India</span> and southeastern <span>China</span> is now usually split as a separate species <i><b>Riparia diluta</b></i>. It has paler grey-brown upperparts and a less distinct breast band. It winters in <span>Pakistan</span> and southern India.</p>
<p>The sand martin's twittering <span>song</span> is continuous when the birds are on the wing, and becomes a conversational undertone after they have settled in the roost. The harsh alarm is heard when a passing <span>falcon</span>, <span>crow</span> or other suspected <span>predator</span> requires combined action to drive it away.</p>
<p>This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758, and originally named <i>Hirundo riparia</i>; the description consisted of the simple <i>H[irundo] cinerea, gula abdomineque albis</i>&#x2014;"an ash-grey swallow, with white throat and belly"&#x2014;and the <span>type locality</span> was simply given as "Europa". The <span>specific name</span> means "of the riverbank"; it is derived from the <span>Latin</span> <i>ripa</i> "riverbank".</p>

Active breeding colony</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Linnaeus already remarked on this species' breeding habits: <i>Habitat in Europae collibus arenosis abruptis, foramine serpentino</i> &#x2013; "it lives in Europe, in winding holes in sheer sandy hills". It is generally found near larger bodies of water, such as <span>rivers</span>, <span>lakes</span> or even the <span>ocean</span>, throughout the year.</p>
<p>The sand martin appears on its breeding grounds as the first of its family, starting towards the end of March, just in advance of the <span>barn swallow</span>. In northern <span>Ohio</span>, they arrive in numbers by mid-April, about 10 days earlier than they did 100 years ago. At first, they flit over the larger bodies of water alone, in search of early flies. Later parties accompany other swallow species, but for a time, varying according to weather, the birds remain at these large waters and do not visit their nesting haunts. The sand martin departs early, at any rate from its more northerly haunts. In August, the gatherings at the nightly roost increase enormously, though the advent and departure of passage birds causes great irregularity in numbers. They are essentially gone from their breeding range by the end of September.</p>

Nest with egg</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The food consists of small insects, mostly <span>gnats</span> and other flies whose early stages are <span>aquatic</span>.</p>
<p>The sand martin is <span>sociable in its nesting habits</span>; from a dozen to many hundred pairs will nest close together, according to available space. The <span>nests</span> are at the end of tunnels of from a few inches to three or four feet in length, bored in sand or <span>gravel</span>. The actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow; it soon becomes a hotbed of parasites. Four or five white <span>eggs</span> are laid about mid-late May, and a second brood is usual in all but the most northernly breeding sites.</p>
<p>This is not a rare bird, and it is classified as a species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. It does have some local protections, as certain populations have declined or face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. They are considered threatened in California, where populations exist in the <span>Sacramento Valley</span> and at two coastal sites, <span>Ano Nuevo</span> and <span>Fort Funston</span></p>
