<p>The <b>Common Sandpiper</b> (<i>Actitis hypoleucos</i>) is a small <span>Palearctic</span> <span>wader</span>. This bird and its <span>American</span> <span>sister species</span>, the <span>Spotted Sandpiper</span> (<i>A. macularia</i>), make up the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Actitis</span></i>. They are <span>parapatric</span> and replace each other geographically; stray birds of either species may settle down with breeders of the other and <span>hybridize</span>. Hybridization has also been <span>reported</span> between the Common Sandpiper and the <span>Green Sandpiper</span>, a <span>basal</span> species of the closely related shank genus <i><span>Tringa</span></i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The adult is 18&#x2013;20&#xA0;cm long with a 32&#x2013;35&#xA0;cm wingspan. It has greyish-brown upperparts, white underparts, short dark-yellowish legs and feet, and a bill with a pale base and dark tip. In winter plumage, they are duller and have more conspicuous barring on the wings, though this is still only visible at close range. Juveniles are more heavily barred above and have buff edges to the wing feathers.</p>
<p>This species is very similar to the slightly larger <span>Spotted Sandpiper</span> (<i>A. macularia</i>) in non-breeding plumage. But its darker legs and feet and the crisper wing pattern (visible in flight) tend to give it away, and of course they are only rarely found in the same location.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>It is a gregarious bird and is seen in large flocks, and has the distinctive stiff-winged flight, low over the water, of <i><span>Actitis</span></i> waders. The Common Sandpiper breeds across most of <span>temperate</span> and <span>subtropical</span> <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>, and <span>migrates</span> to <span>Africa</span>, southern <span>Asia</span> and <span>Australia</span> in winter. The eastern edge of its migration route passes by <span>Palau</span> in <span>Micronesia</span>, where hundreds of birds may gather for a stop-over. They depart the Palau region for their breeding quarters around the last week of April to the first week of May.</p>

<p>The Common Sandpiper forages by sight on the ground or in shallow water, picking up small food items such as <span>insects</span>, <span>crustaceans</span> and other <span>invertebrates</span>; it may even catch insects in flight. In the Nukumanu language of the <span>Nukumanu Islands</span> (<span>Papua New Guinea</span>), this species is usually called <i><b>tiritavoi</b></i>. Another Nukumanu name for it, <i><b>matakakoni</b></i>, exists, but this is considered somewhat <span>taboo</span> and not used when children and women are around. The reason for this is that <i>matakakoni</i> means "bird that walks a little, then copulates", in reference to the pumping tail and thrusting head movements the <i>Actitis</i> species characteristically perform during foraging.</p>
<p>It nests on the ground near <span>freshwater</span>. When threatened, the young may cling to their parent's body to be flown away to safety.</p>
<p>The Common Sandpiper is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>It is widespread and common, and therefore classified as a Species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span> but is a vulnerable species in some states of Australia.</p>
