<p>The <b>Upcher's Warbler</b>, (<i><b>Hippolais languida</b></i>), is an <span>Old World warbler</span> in the <span>tree warbler</span> genus <i>Hippolais</i>. It breeds in an area from <span>Turkey</span> south and east to <span>Pakistan</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in eastern <span>Africa</span>, from <span>Eritrea</span> and <span>Somalia</span> south to <span>Tanzania</span>.</p>
<p>This small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> is a species found in semi-desert habitats, frequenting bushy scrub and thickets of <span>tamarisk</span>. 4-5 eggs are laid in a nest in bushes and low trees.</p>
<p>This is a medium-sized warbler, similar in size to the <span>Icterine Warbler</span>, with a slightly longer bill and shorter wings and a longer tail. Its frequent tail movement is reminiscent of a <i><span>Sylvia</span></i> warbler or a <span>Chat</span>. Its rather grey plumage is similar to the <span>Olivaceous Warbler</span>, but tail movements are diagnostic.</p>
<p>It feeds on invertebrates. Its song is similar to that of other <i>Hippolais</i> warblers, but distinctive and unmistakable, and entirely different from that of the Olivaceous Warbler.</p>
<p><span>Ehrenberg</span>'s original description of this bird was 'rather vague' and it was redescribed by <span>Henry Baker Tristram</span> in 1864, naming it <i>Hippolais upcheri</i> after his friend <span>Henry Morris Upcher</span>. This is the origin of the bird's common name.</p>
