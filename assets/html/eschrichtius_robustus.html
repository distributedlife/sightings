<p>The <b>gray whale</b> (<i>Eschrichtius robustus</i>) is a <span>baleen</span> <span>whale</span> that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a length of 14.9 meters (49&#xA0;ft), a weight of 36 tonnes (40 short tons), and lives between 55 and 70 years. The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. Gray whales were once called <b>devil fish</b> because of their fighting behavior when hunted. The gray whale is the sole living species in the <span>genus</span> <i><b>Eschrichtius</b></i>, which in turn is the sole living genus in the <span>family</span> <span>Eschrichtiidae</span>. This mammal descended from filter-feeding whales that developed at the beginning of the <span>Oligocene</span>, over 30 million years ago.</p>
<p>The gray whale is distributed in an eastern North Pacific (North American) population and a critically endangered western North Pacific (Asian) population. North Atlantic populations were <span>extirpated</span> (perhaps by <span>whaling</span>) on the European coast before 500 AD and on the American coast around the late 17th to early 18th centuries. However, on May 8, 2010, a sighting of a gray whale was confirmed off the coast of <span>Israel</span> in the <span>Mediterranean Sea</span>, leading some scientists to think they might be repopulating old breeding grounds that have not been used for centuries. In May and June 2013 a gray whale was sighted off the coast of <span>Namibia</span> &#x2013; the first confirmed in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

Skeleton</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. Recent <span>DNA</span> analysis indicates certain <span>rorquals</span> of the family <span>Balaenopteridae</span>, such as the <span>humpback whale</span>, <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>, and <span>fin whale</span>, <i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the <span>minke whales</span>. <span>John Edward Gray</span> placed it in its own genus in 1865, naming it in honour of zoologist Daniel Eschricht. The common name of the whale comes from its coloration. The subfossil remains of now extinct gray whales from the Atlantic coasts of <span>England</span> and <span>Sweden</span> were used by Gray to make the first scientific description of a species then surviving only in Pacific waters. The living Pacific species was described by Cope as <i>Rhachianectes glaucus</i> in 1869. Skeletal comparisons showed the Pacific species to be identical to the Atlantic remains in the 1930s, and Gray's naming has been generally accepted since. Although identity between the Atlantic and Pacific populations cannot be proven by anatomical data, its skeleton is distinctive and easy to distinguish from that of all other living whales.</p>
<p>Many other names have been ascribed to the gray whale, including desert whale, devil fish, gray back, mussel digger and rip sack. The name <i>Eschrichtius gibbosus</i> is sometimes seen; this is dependent on the acceptance of a 1777 description by Erxleben.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The gray whale has a dark slate-gray color and is covered by characteristic gray-white patterns, scars left by <span>parasites</span> which drop off in its cold feeding grounds. Individual whales are typically identified using photographs of their dorsal surface and matching the scars and patches associated with parasites that have fallen off the whale or are still attached.</p>
<p>Gray whales measure from 4.9&#xA0;m (16&#xA0;ft) in length for newborns to 13&#x2013;15&#xA0;m (43&#x2013;49&#xA0;ft) for adults (females tend to be slightly larger than adult males). Newborns are a darker gray to black in color. A mature gray whale can reach 40&#xA0;t (44 short tons), with a typical range of 15&#x2013;33&#xA0;t (17&#x2013;36 short tons).</p>
<p>They have two blowholes on top of their head, which can create a distinctive V-shaped blow at the surface in calm wind conditions.</p>

<p>Notable features that distinguish the gray whale from other <span>mysticetes</span> include its <span>baleen</span> that is variously described as cream, off-white, or blond in color and is unusually short. Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone stiff hair, but are only visible on close inspection. Its head's ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat's underside. The gray whale also lacks a <span>dorsal fin</span>, instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations ("knuckles"), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the <span>flukes</span>.This is known as the <span>dorsal ridge</span>. The tail itself is 3&#x2013;3.5&#xA0;m (10&#x2013;11&#xA0;ft) across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.</p>

Gray whales <span>breaching</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two Pacific Ocean populations are known to exist: one of not more than 130 individuals (according to the most recent population assessment in 2008) whose migratory route is presumed to be between the <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span> and southern Korea, and a larger one with a population between 20,000 and 22,000 individuals in the eastern Pacific traveling between the waters off <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Baja California Sur</span>. The western population is listed as <span>critically endangered</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. No new reproductive females were recorded in 2010, resulting in a minimum of 26 reproductive females being observed since 1995. Even a very small number of additional annual female deaths will cause the subpopulation to decline.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</span></h3>
<p>The gray whale became extinct in the <span>North Atlantic</span> in the 18th century. Radiocarbon dating of subfossil or fossil European (Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) coastal remains confirms this, with whaling the possible cause. Remains dating from the Roman epoch were found in the <span>Mediterranean</span> during excavation of the antique harbor of <span>Lattara</span> near <span>Montpellier</span> in 1997, raising the question of whether Atlantic gray whales migrated up and down the coast of Europe from <span>Wadden Sea</span> to calve in the Mediterranean. Similarly, radiocarbon dating of American east coastal subfossil remains confirm gray whales existed at least through the 17th century. This population ranged at least from <span>Southampton, New York</span>, to <span>Jupiter Island, Florida</span>, the latest from 1675. In his 1835 history of <span>Nantucket Island</span>, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony a whale of the kind called "scragg" entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. A. B. Van Deinse points out that the "scrag whale", described by P. Dudley in 1725 as one of the species hunted by the early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale.</p>

<p>In 2007, S. Elizabeth Alter used a genetic approach to estimate pre-whaling abundance based on samples from 42 California gray whales, and reported DNA variability at 10 genetic loci consistent with a population size of 76,000&#x2013;118,000 individuals, three to five times larger than the average census size as measured through 2007. NOAA conducted a new populations study in 2010&#x2013;2011; those data will be available by 2012. The ocean ecosystem has likely changed since the prewhaling era, making a return to prewhaling numbers infeasible; many marine ecologists argue that existing gray whale numbers in the eastern Pacific Ocean are approximately at the population's carrying capacity.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Eastern_and_western_populations">Eastern and western populations</span></h4>
<p>Several whales seen off Sakhalin and on <span>Kamchatka Peninsula</span> are confirmed to migrate towards eastern side of Pacific and join the larger eastern population. In January 2011, a gray whale that had been tagged in the western population was tracked as far east as the eastern population range off the coast of British Columbia.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="From_North_Pacific_Ocean_to_outside_of_the_Pacific">From North Pacific Ocean to outside of the Pacific</span></h4>
<p>In mid-1980, there were three gray whale sightings in the eastern <span>Beaufort Sea</span>, placing them 585 kilometers (364&#xA0;mi) further east than their known range at the time. Recent increases in sightings are confirmed in Arctic areas of the historic range for Atlantic stocks, most notably on several locations in the <span>Laptev Sea</span> including the <span>New Siberian Islands</span> in the <span>East Siberian Sea</span>, and around the marine mammal sanctuary of the <span>Franz Josef Land</span>, indicating possible earlier pioneers of re-colonizations. These whales were darker in body color than those whales seen in Sea of Okhotsk. In May 2010, a gray whale was sighted off the Mediterranean shore of Israel. It has been speculated that this whale crossed from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the <span>Northwest Passage</span>, since an alternative route around <span>Cape Horn</span> would not be contiguous to the whale's established territory. There has been gradual melting and recession of Arctic sea ice with extreme loss in 2007 rendering the Northwest Passage "fully navigable". The same whale was sighted again on May 30, 2010, off the coast of <span>Barcelona</span>, Spain.</p>
<p>In May 2013, a gray whale was sighted off <span>Walvis Bay</span>, Namibia. Scientists from the Namibian Dolphin Project confirmed the whale's identity and thus provides the only sighting of this species in the Southern Hemisphere. Photographic identification suggests that this is a different individual than the one spotted in the Mediterranean in 2010. As of July 2013, the Namibian whale was still being seen regularly.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote boilerplate seealso">See also: <span>Whale reproduction</span></div>
<p>Breeding behavior is complex and often involves three or more animals. Both male and female whales reach puberty at approximately eight years of age. Females show highly synchronized reproduction, undergoing oestrus in late November to early December. During the breeding season, it is common for females to have several mates. This single ovulation event is believed to coincide with the species&#x2019; annual migration patterns, when births can occur in warmer waters. Most females show biennial reproduction, although annual births have been reported. Males also show seasonal changes, experiencing an increase in testes mass that correlates with the time females undergo oestrus. Currently there are no accounts of twin births, although an instance of twins <i>in utero</i> has been reported.</p>
<p>The gestation period for gray whales is approximately 13&#xA0;<span class="frac nowrap">&#x2044;<sub>2</sub></span> months. In the latter half of the pregnancy, the fetus experiences a rapid growth in length and mass. Similar to the narrow breeding season, most calves are born within a six-week time period in mid January. The calf is born tail first, and measures about 4&#xA0;m (13&#xA0;ft) in length. Females lactate for approximately seven months following birth, at which point calves are weaned and maternal care begins to decrease. The shallow lagoon waters in which gray whales reproduce are believed to protect the newborn from <span>sharks</span> and <span>orcas</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The whale feeds mainly on <span>benthic</span> <span>crustaceans</span>, which it eats by turning on its side (usually the right, resulting in loss of eyesight in the right eye for many older animals) and scooping up sediments from the sea floor. It is classified as a <span>baleen whale</span> and has <span>baleen</span>, or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including <span>amphipods</span> taken in along with <span>sand</span>, <span>water</span> and other material. Mostly, the animal feeds in the northern waters during the summer; and opportunistically feeds during its migration, depending primarily on its extensive fat reserves. Calf gray whales drink 190&#x2013;300&#xA0;US&#xA0;gal (720&#x2013;1,140&#xA0;l) of their mothers' 53% fat milk per day.</p>
<p>The main feeding habitat of the western Pacific subpopulation is the shallow (5&#x2013;15&#xA0;m (16&#x2013;49&#xA0;ft) depth) shelf off northeastern <span>Sakhalin Island</span>, particularly off the southern portion of Piltun Lagoon, where the main prey species appear to be <span>amphipods</span> and isopods. In some years, the whales have also used an offshore feeding ground in 30&#x2013;35&#xA0;m (98&#x2013;115&#xA0;ft) depth southeast of Chayvo Bay, where benthic amphipods and <span>cumaceans</span> are the main prey species. Some gray whales have also been seen off western Kamchatka, but to date all whales photographed there are also known from the Piltun area.</p>

</div>
<p>Each October, as the northern ice pushes southward, small groups of eastern gray whales in the eastern Pacific start a two- to three-month, 8,000&#x2013;11,000&#xA0;km (5,000&#x2013;6,800&#xA0;mi) trip south. Beginning in the <span>Bering</span> and <span>Chukchi</span> seas and ending in the warm-water <span>lagoons</span> of Mexico's <span>Baja peninsula</span> and the southern <span>Gulf of California</span>, they travel along the west coast of <span>Canada</span>, the <span>United States</span> and <span>Mexico</span>.</p>
<p>Traveling night and day, the gray whale averages approximately 120&#xA0;km (75&#xA0;mi) per day at an average speed of 8&#xA0;km/h (5&#xA0;mph). This round trip of 16,000&#x2013;22,000&#xA0;km (9,900&#x2013;13,700&#xA0;mi) is believed to be the longest annual migration of any <span>mammal</span>. By mid-December to early January, the majority are usually found between <span>Monterey</span> and <span>San Diego</span> such as at <span>Morro bay</span>, often visible from shore. The <span>whale watching</span> industry provides <span>ecotourists</span> and <span>marine mammal</span> enthusiasts the opportunity to see groups of gray whales as they migrate.</p>
<p>By late December to early January, eastern grays begin to arrive in the calving lagoons of Baja. The three most popular lagoons are <span>Laguna Ojo de Liebre</span> (formerly known in English as Scammon's Lagoon after whaleman <span>Charles Melville Scammon</span>, who discovered the lagoons in the 1850s and hunted the grays), <span>San Ignacio</span>, and <span>Magdalena</span>.</p>
<p>These first whales to arrive are usually pregnant mothers looking for the protection of the lagoons to bear their calves, along with single females seeking mates. By mid-February to mid-March, the bulk of the population has arrived in the lagoons, filling them with nursing, calving and mating gray whales.</p>
<p>Throughout February and March, the first to leave the lagoons are males and females without new calves. Pregnant females and nursing mothers with their newborns are the last to depart, leaving only when their calves are ready for the journey, which is usually from late March to mid-April. Often, a few mothers linger with their young calves well into May.</p>
<p>By late March or early April, the returning animals can be seen from <span>Everett, Washington</span>, to <span>Puget Sound</span> to <span>Canada</span>.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Resident_group">Resident group</span></h5>
<p>A population of about 200 gray whales stay along the eastern Pacific coast from Canada to California throughout the summer, not making the farther trip to Alaskan waters. This summer resident group is known as the Pacific Coast feeding group.</p>
<p>Any historical or current presence of similar groups of residents among the western population is currently unknown. Some observations indicate that historic presences of resident whales are possible: two whales stayed in <span>Ise Bay</span> for almost two months in the 1980s, and, in 2012, the possible first confirmed living individuals in the Sea of Japan since the end of whaling stayed for about three weeks on the coastline of <span>Teradomari</span> in 2014.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Western_population">Western population</span></h4>
<p>The current western gray whale population summers in the <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span>, mainly off <span>Piltun Bay</span> region at the northeastern coast of <span>Sakhalin Island</span> (<span>Russian Federation</span>). There are also occasional sightings off the eastern coast of Kamchatka (Russian Federation) and in other coastal waters of the northern Okhotsk Sea. Its migration routes and wintering grounds are poorly known, the only recent information being from occasional records on both the eastern and western coasts of <span>Japan</span> and along the Chinese coast.</p>
<p>The <span>Sea of Japan</span> was once thought not to have been a migration route, until several entanglements were recorded. However, there were numerous records of whales along the <span>Genkai Sea</span> off <span>Yamaguchi Prefecture</span>, in Ine Bay in the <span>Gulf of Wakasa</span>, and in <span>Tsushima</span>. Gray whales, along with other species such as right whales and <span>Baird's beaked whales</span>, were common features off the north eastern coast of <span>Hokkaido</span> near <span>Teshio</span>, <span>Ishikari Bay</span> near <span>Otaru</span>, the <span>Shakotan Peninsula</span>, and islands in the <span>La P&#xE9;rouse Strait</span> such as <span>Rebun Island</span> and <span>Rishiri Island</span>. These areas may also have included feeding grounds. There are shallow, muddy areas favorable for feeding whales off <span>Shiretoko</span>, such as at <span>Shibetsu</span>, the <span>Notsuke Peninsula</span>, Cape Ochiishi on <span>Nemuro Peninsula</span>, <span>Mutsu Bay</span>, along the <span>Tottori Sand Dunes</span>, in the <span>Suou-nada Sea</span>, and <span>Omura Bay</span>.</p>
<p>The historical calving grounds were unknown but might have been along southern Chinese coasts from <span>Zhejiang</span> and <span>Fujian Province</span> to <span>Guangdong</span>, especially near <span>Hong Kong</span>. Possibilities include <span>Daya Bay</span>, <span>Wailou</span> Harbour on <span>Leizhou Peninsula</span>, and possibly as far south as <span>Hainan Province</span> and <span>Guangxi</span>, particularly around <span>Hainan Island</span>. These areas are at the southwestern end of the known range. It is unknown whether the whales' normal range once reached further south, to the <span>Gulf of Tonkin</span>. In addition, the existence of historical calving ground on <span>Taiwan</span> (with some fossil records and captures), and any presence in other areas outside of the known ranges off <span>Babuyan Islands</span> in <span>Philippines</span> are unknown. Gray whales are known to occur in <span>Taiwan Strait</span> even in recent years.</p>
<p>There have been unidentified sightings in <span>Tokara Islands</span> and <span>Ryukyu Islands</span> in recent years.</p>
<p>It is also unknown whether any winter breeding grounds ever existed beyond Chinese coasts. For example, it is not known if the whales visited the southern coasts of the Korean Peninsula, adjacent to the <span>Island of Jeju</span>), <span>Haiyang</span> Island, the Gulf of <span>Shanghai</span>, or the <span>Zhoushan Archipelago</span>. There is no evidence of historical presence in Japan south of <span>&#x14C;sumi Peninsula</span>; only one skeleton has been discovered in <span>Miyazaki Prefecture</span>. <span>Hideo Omura</span> once considered the <span>Seto Inland Sea</span> to be a historical breeding ground, but only a handful of capture records support this idea, although migrations into the sea have been confirmed.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_migration_in_Asian_waters">Recent migration in Asian waters</span></h4>
<p>Even though <span>South Korea</span> put the most effort into conservation of the species among the Asian nations, there are no confirmed sightings along the Korean Peninsula or even in the Sea of Japan in recent years. The last record in Korean waters was the sighting of a pair off <span>Bangeojin</span>, <span>Ulsan</span> in 1977.</p>
<p>A fully-grown female was killed by entanglement in <span>Pingtan</span>, <span>China</span> in November, 2007.</p>
<p>Since the mid 1990s, almost all the confirmed records of living animals in Asian waters were from Japanese coasts. There have been eight to fifteen sightings and stray records including unconfirmed sightings and re-sightings of the same individual, and one later killed in net-entanglement. The most notable of these observations are listed below:</p>


<ul>
<li>Another pair of sub-adults were confirmed swimming near the mouth of Otani River in <span>Suruga Bay</span> in May, 2003.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A sub-adult whale that stayed in the Ise and <span>Mikawa Bay</span> for nearly two months in 2012 was later confirmed to be the same individual as the small whale observed off <span>Tahara</span> near the <span>Cape Irago</span> in 2010, making it the first confirmed constant migration out of Russian waters. The juvenile observed off <span>Owase</span> in Kumanonada Sea in 2009 might or might not be the same individual. The Ise and Mikawa Bay region is the only location along Japanese coasts that has several records since the 1980s, and is also the location where the first commercial whaling started. Other areas with several sighting or stranding records in recent years are off Kumanonada Sea in <span>Wakayama</span>, off <span>Oshika Peninsula</span> in <span>Tohoku</span>, and on coastlines close to <span>Tomakomai</span>, <span>Hokkaido</span>.</li>

<li>A possible sighting of a gray whale underwater off <span>Miyako Island</span> in November, 2009. If this animal is confirmed to be a gray whale, it will make the first ever record of any gray whale migrating to the Ryukyu Islands. An unspecified sighting in Tokara strait also exists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Possibly the first ever confirmed record of living animals in Japanese waters in the Sea of Japan since the end of whaling occurred on 3 April 2014 at Nodumi Beach, <span>Teradomari, Niigata</span>. Two individuals, measuring ten and five metres respectively, stayed near the mouth of <span>Shinano River</span> for three weeks. It is unknown whether these animals are a cow-calf pair, but, if so, it will be the first record of a living cow-calf pair in any Asian nation. All of the previous modern records in the Sea of Japan were of strandings.</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Eastern_population_2">Eastern population</span></h4>
<p>Humans and the <span>killer whale</span> (orca) are the adult gray whale's only predators. Aboriginal hunters, including those on <span>Vancouver Island</span> and the <span>Makah</span> in <span>Washington</span>, have hunted gray whales.</p>
<p>Commercial whaling by Europeans of the species in the North Pacific began in the winter of 1845&#x2013;46, when two United States ships, the <i>Hibernia</i> and the <i>United States</i>, under Captains Smith and Stevens, caught 32 in <span>Magdalena Bay</span>. More ships followed in the two following winters, after which gray whaling in the bay was nearly abandoned because "of the inferior quality and low price of the dark-colored gray whale oil, the low quality and quantity of whalebone from the gray, and the dangers of lagoon whaling."</p>
<p>Gray whaling in Magdalena Bay was revived in the winter of 1855&#x2013;56 by several vessels, mainly from <span>San Francisco</span>, including the ship <i>Leonore</i>, under Captain <span>Charles Melville Scammon</span>. This was the first of 11 winters from 1855 through 1865 known as the "bonanza period", during which gray whaling along the coast of Baja California reached its peak. Not only were the whales taken in Magdalena Bay, but also by ships anchored along the coast from San Diego south to <span>Cabo San Lucas</span> and from whaling stations from <span>Crescent City</span> in northern California south to San Ignacio Lagoon. During the same period, vessels targeting <span>right</span> and <span>bowhead whales</span> in the <span>Gulf of Alaska</span>, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Western Arctic would take the odd gray whale if neither of the more desirable two species were in sight.</p>
<p>In December 1857, Charles Scammon, in the brig <i>Boston</i>, along with his schooner-tender <i>Marin</i>, entered Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Jack-Rabbit Spring Lagoon) or later known as Scammon's Lagoon (by 1860) and found one of the gray's last refuges. He caught 20 whales. He returned the following winter (1858&#x2013;59) with the bark <i>Ocean Bird</i> and schooner tenders <i>A.M. Simpson</i> and <i>Kate</i>. In three months, he caught 47 cows, yielding 1,700 barrels (270&#xA0;m) of oil. In the winter of 1859&#x2013;60, Scammon, again in the bark <i>Ocean Bird</i>, along with several other vessels, performed a similar feat of daring by entering San Ignacio Lagoon to the south where he discovered the last breeding lagoon. Within only a couple of seasons, the lagoon was nearly devoid of whales.</p>
<p>Between 1846 and 1874, an estimated 8,000 gray whales were killed by American and European whalemen, with over half having been killed in the Magdalena Bay complex (Estero Santo Domingo, Magdalena Bay itself, and Almejas Bay) and by shore whalemen in California and Baja California. This, for the most part, does not take into account the large number of calves injured or left to starve after their mothers had been killed in the breeding lagoons. Since whalemen primarily targeted these new mothers, several thousand deaths should probably be added to the total. Shore whaling in California and Baja California continued after this period, until the early 20th century.</p>
<p>A second, shorter, and less intensive hunt occurred for gray whales in the eastern North Pacific. Only a few were caught from two whaling stations on the coast of California from 1919 to 1926, and a single station in Washington (1911&#x2013;21) accounted for the capture of another. For the entire west coast of North America for the years 1919 to 1929, some 234 gray whales were caught. Only a dozen or so were taken by British Columbian stations, nearly all of them in 1953 at <span>Coal Harbour</span>. A whaling station in <span>Richmond, California</span>, caught 311 gray whales for "scientific purposes" between 1964 and 1969. From 1961 to 1972, the Soviet Union caught 138 gray whales (they originally reported not having taken any). The only other significant catch was made in two seasons by the steam-schooner <i>California</i> off <span>Malibu, California</span>. In the winters of 1934&#x2013;35 and 1935&#x2013;36, the <i>California</i> anchored off <span>Point Dume</span> in Paradise Cove, processing gray whales. In 1936, gray whales became protected in the United States.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Western_population_2">Western population</span></h4>
<p>The Japanese began to catch gray whales beginning in the 1570s. At Kawajiri, <span>Nagato</span>, 169 gray whales were caught between 1698 and 1889. At <span>Tsuro</span>, <span>Shikoku</span>, 201 were taken between 1849 and 1896. Several hundred more were probably caught by American and European whalemen in the <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span> from the 1840s to the early 20th century. Whalemen caught 44 with nets in Japan during the 1890s. The real damage was done between 1911 and 1933, when Japanese whalemen killed 1,449 after Japanese companies established several whaling stations on <span>Korean Peninsula</span> and on Chinese coast such as near the Daya bay and on Hainan Island. By 1934, the western gray whale was near extinction. From 1891 to 1966, an estimated 1,800&#x2013;2,000 gray whales were caught, with peak catches of between 100 and 200 annually occurring in the 1910s.</p>
<p>As of 2001, the Californian gray whale population had grown to about 26,000. As of 2011, the population of western Pacific (seas near Korea, Japan, and <span>Kamchatka</span>) gray whales was an estimated 130.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="North_Atlantic_2">North Atlantic</span></h3>
<p>The North Atlantic population may have been hunted to extinction in the 18th century. Circumstantial evidence indicates whaling could have contributed to this population's decline, as the increase in whaling activity in the 17th and 18th centuries coincided with the population's disappearance. A. B. Van Deinse points out the "scrag whale", described by P. Dudley in 1725, as one target of early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale. In his 1835 history of <span>Nantucket Island</span>, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony, a whale of the kind called "scragg" entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. Gray whales (Icelandic <i>sandl&#xE6;gja</i>) were described in Iceland in the early 17th century.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Gray whales have been granted protection from commercial hunting by the <span>International Whaling Commission</span> (IWC) since 1949, and are no longer hunted on a large scale.</p>
<p>Limited hunting of gray whales has continued since that time, however, primarily in the <span>Chukotka</span> region of northeastern Russia, where large numbers of gray whales spend the summer months. This hunt has been allowed under an "aboriginal/subsistence whaling" exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the <span>Soviet</span> government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice. The Russian IWC delegation has said that the hunt is justified under the aboriginal/subsistence exemption, since the fur farms provide a necessary economic base for the region's native population.</p>
<p>Currently, the annual quota for the gray whale catch in the region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Russia, the <span>Makah</span> tribe of <span>Washington</span> claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal <span>appeals court</span> decision in December 2002 that required the <span>National Marine Fisheries Service</span> to prepare an <span>Environmental Impact Statement</span>. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea.</p>
<p>As of 2008, the <span>IUCN</span> regards the gray whale as being of "Least Concern" from a conservation perspective. However, the specific subpopulation in the northwest Pacific is regarded as being "Critically Endangered". The northwest Pacific population is also listed as endangered by the U.S. government&#x2019;s <span>National Marine Fisheries Service</span> under the U.S. <span>Endangered Species Act</span>. The IWC Bowhead, Right and Gray Whale subcommittee in 2011 reiterated the conservation risk to western gray whales is large because of the small size of the population and the potential anthropogenic impacts.</p>
<p>In their breeding grounds in <span>Baja California</span>, Mexican law protects whales in their lagoons while still permitting whale watching. Gray whales are protected under Canada's <span>Species at Risk Act</span> which obligates Canadian governments to prepare management plans for the whales and consider the interests of the whales when permitting development.</p>
<p>Gray Whale migrations off of the Pacific Coast were observed, initially, by Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, California. The Gray Whale Census, an official Gray Whale migration census that has been recording data on the migration of the Pacific Gray Whale has been keeping track of the population of the Pacific Gray Whale since 1985. This census is the longest running census of the Pacific Gray Whale. Census keepers volunteer from December 1 through May, from sun up to sun down, seven days a week, keeping track of the amount of Gray Whales migrating through the area off of Los Angeles. Information from this census is listed through the American Cetacean Society of Los Angeles (ACSLA).</p>
<p>In 2005 two conservation biologists proposed a plan to airlift 50 gray whales from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. They reasoned that, as Californian gray whales had replenished to a suitable population, surplus whales could be transported to repopulate the extinct British population. As of 2013 this plan has not been undertaken.</p>
<p>China also lists gray whales as a protected species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats">Threats</span></h2>
<p>According to the Government of Canada's Management Plan for gray whales, threats to the eastern North Pacific population of gray whales include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased human activities in their breeding lagoons in Mexico</li>
<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Acute noise</li>
<li>The threat of toxic spills</li>
<li>Aboriginal whaling</li>
<li>Entanglement with fishing gear</li>
<li>Boat collisions</li>
<li>Impacts from fossil fuel exploration and extraction</li>
</ul>
<p>Western gray whales are facing, the large-scale offshore oil and gas development programs near their summer feeding ground, as well as fatal net entrapments off Japan during migration, which pose significant threats to the future survival of the population.</p>
<p>The substantial nearshore industrialization and shipping congestion throughout the migratory corridors of the western gray whale population represent potential threats by increasing the likelihood of exposure to ship strikes, chemical pollution, and general disturbance.</p>
<p>Offshore gas and oil development in the Okhotsk Sea within 20&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) of the primary feeding ground off <span>northeast Sakhalin Island</span> is of particular concern. Activities related to oil and gas exploration, including geophysical seismic surveying, pipelaying and drilling operations, increased vessel traffic, and oil spills, all pose potential threats to western gray whales. Disturbance from underwater industrial noise may displace whales from critical feeding habitat. Physical habitat damage from drilling and dredging operations, combined with possible impacts of oil and chemical spills on benthic prey communities also warrants concern.</p>
<p>Along Japanese coasts, four females including a cow-calf pair were trapped and killed in nets in the 2000s. A carcass of an illegally hunted specimen was found on Hokkaido in the 1990s. Meats for sale were also discovered in Japanese markets as well.</p>

A gray whale in captivity</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because of their size and need to migrate, gray whales have rarely been held in captivity, and then only for brief periods of time.</p>
<p>In 1972, a three-month-old gray whale named Gigi (II) was captured for brief study by Dr. David W. Kenney, and then released near <span>San Diego</span>.</p>
<p>In January 1997, the newborn baby whale J.J. was found helpless near Los Angeles, California, 4.2&#xA0;m (14&#xA0;ft) long and 800 kilograms (1,800&#xA0;lb) in weight. Nursed back to health in <span>SeaWorld San Diego</span>, she was released into the Pacific Ocean on March 31, 1998, 9&#xA0;m (30&#xA0;ft) long and 8,500&#xA0;kg (18,700&#xA0;lb) in mass. She shed her radio transmitter packs three days later.</p>
