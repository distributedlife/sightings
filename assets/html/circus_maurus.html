<p>The <b>black harrier</b> (<i>Circus maurus</i>) is a medium-sized (up to 46&#xA0;cm long) African harrier of <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, and <span>Namibia</span>.</p>
<p>When perched, this bird appears all black. However, in flight a white rump and flight feathers become visible. Its morphology is comparable to that of other harriers, with a slim body, narrow wings and a long tail. Male and female plumages are similar. Juveniles have buff under-parts and a heavily spotted breast.</p>
<p>Like other harriers it nests on the ground in tall vegetation. Three to five eggs are laid and incubated 35 days.</p>
<p>It feeds mostly on small rodents and birds and will occasionally take reptiles, catching them while flying low over its hunting grounds.</p>
<p>The greatest number of breeding pairs can be found in the <span>Western Cape</span> province, South Africa. In this area loose colonies aggregate around coastal wetlands. Breeding in Namibia is suspected but not confirmed.</p>
<p>The black harrier population has declined in recent years to less than 1000 birds and it is now classified as vulnerable, despite still having a wide breeding range. This is due to the destruction of its original breeding habitat, South Africa's natural shrubland, the <span>fynbos</span>, which has been greatly reduced by encroaching cereal culture and urban expansion.</p>
