<p>The <b>Pallas's grasshopper warbler</b> (<i>Locustella certhiola</i>) is an <span>Old World warbler</span> in the <span>grass warbler</span> genus <i>Locustella</i>. It breeds in east <span>Asia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering from <span>India</span> east to <span>Indonesia</span>.</p>

<p>This small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> is found in tall grass with some thicker vegetation, usually close to water in bogs or wet meadows. From 4 to 7 eggs are laid in a nest on the ground in grass. This species is a very rare <span>vagrant</span> to western <span>Europe</span>. One of the best places to see this <span>skulking</span> species as a vagrant is <span>Fair Isle</span>, <span>Shetland</span>; for a species that only rarely appears in western Europe, it can be found there with some regularity. This has made it a sought after species among UK "<span>twitchers</span>".</p>
<p>This is a medium-sized warbler. The adult has a streaked brown back, whitish grey underparts, unstreaked except on the undertail. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. It is very similar to the <span>common grasshopper warbler</span>, but is slightly larger, has white tips to the tail and tertial feathers, and a warmer brown rump. The white tips are the reason for its <span>colloquial</span>, <span>mnenomic</span> name of "<span>PG Tips</span>".</p>
<p>This is a skulky species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.</p>
<p>The song is not the mechanical insect-like reeling produced by the common grasshopper warbler and some other <i>Locustella</i> warblers, but an inventive <i>Acrocephalus</i>-like melody.</p>
<p>This bird was named after the German zoologist <span>Peter Simon Pallas</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the sixth edition of <span>Clements checklist</span>  refers to this species as "Pallas's warbler", a name more commonly used for <i><span>Phylloscopus proregulus</span>.</i></p>
