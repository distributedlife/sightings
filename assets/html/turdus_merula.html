<p>The <b>common blackbird</b> (<i>Turdus merula</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>true thrush</span>. It is also called <b>Eurasian blackbird</b> (especially in North America, to distinguish it from the unrelated <span>New World blackbirds</span>), or simply <b>blackbird</b>, where this does not lead to confusion with a <span class="nowrap">similar-looking</span> local species. It breeds in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been <span>introduced</span> to <span>Australia</span> (where it is considered a pest) and <span>New Zealand</span>. It has a number of <span>subspecies</span> across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on <span>latitude</span>, the common blackbird may be <span>resident</span>, partially <span>migratory</span> or fully migratory.</p>
<p>The male of the <span>nominate subspecies</span>, which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and <span>bill</span> and has a rich melodious <span>song</span>; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown <span>plumage</span>. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is <span>omnivorous</span>, eating a wide range of <span>insects</span>, <span>earthworms</span>, <span>berries</span>, and <span>fruits</span>.</p>
<p>Both sexes are <span>territorial</span> on the breeding grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs will stay in their territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently <span>temperate</span>. This common and conspicuous species has given rise to a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>The common blackbird was described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in the <span>10th edition</span> of his <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i> in 1758 as <i>Turdus merula</i> (characterised as <i>T. ater, rostro palpebrisque fulvis</i>). The binomial name derives from two <span>Latin</span> words, <i>turdus</i>, "thrush", and <i>merula</i>, "blackbird", the latter giving rise to its <span>French</span> name, <i>merle</i>, and its <span>Scots</span> name, <i>merl</i>. There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus <i>Turdus</i>, characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. The common blackbird seems to be closest in evolutionary terms to the <span>island thrush</span> (<i>T.&#xA0;poliocephalus</i>) of <span>Southeast Asia</span> and islands in the southwest <span>Pacific</span>, which probably diverged from <i>merula</i> stock fairly recently.</p>
<p>It may not immediately be clear why the name "blackbird", first recorded in 1486, was applied to this species, but not to one of the various other common black English birds, such as the <span>carrion crow</span>, <span>raven</span>, <span>rook</span> or <span>jackdaw</span>. However, in <span>Old English</span>, and in <span>modern English</span> up to about the 18th century, "bird" was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones such as crows were called "fowl". At that time, the blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous "black bird" in the British Isles. Until about the 17th century, another name for the species was <i>ouzel</i>, <i>ousel</i> or <i>wosel</i> (from <span>Old English</span> <i>osle</i>, cf. <span>German</span> <i>Amsel</i>). Another variant occurs in Act 3 of <span>Shakespeare's</span> <i><span>A Midsummer Night's Dream</span></i>, where <span>Bottom</span> refers to "The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill". The ouzel usage survived later in <span>poetry</span>, and still occurs as the name of the closely related <span>ring ouzel</span> (<i>Turdus torquatus</i>), and in <i>water ouzel</i>, an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar <span>white-throated dipper</span> (<i>Cinclus cinclus</i>).</p>

<p>Two related Asian <i>Turdus</i> <span>thrushes</span>, the <span>white-collared blackbird</span> (<i>T. albocinctus</i>) and the <span>grey-winged blackbird</span> (<i>T. boulboul</i>), are also named blackbirds, and the <span>Somali thrush</span> (<i>T. (olivaceus) ludoviciae</i>) is alternatively known as the Somali blackbird.</p>
<p>The <span>icterid</span> family of the New World is sometimes called the blackbird family because of some species' superficial resemblance to the common blackbird and other Old World thrushes, but they are not evolutionarily close, being related to the <span>New World warblers</span> and <span>tanagers</span>. The term is often limited to smaller species with mostly or entirely black plumage, at least in the breeding male, notably the <span>cowbirds</span>, the <span>grackles</span>, and for around 20 species with "blackbird" in the name, such as the <span>red-winged blackbird</span> and the <span>melodious blackbird</span>.</p>

<p>As would be expected for a widespread passerine bird species, several geographical subspecies are recognised. The treatment of subspecies in this article follows Clement <i>et al.</i> (2000).</p>

<p>The Asian subspecies, the relatively large <i>intermedius</i> and <i>mandarinus</i>, and the smaller <i>sowerbyi</i>, also differ in structure and voice, and may represent a distinct species, the Chinese blackbird (<i>T. mandarinus</i>). Alternatively, it has been suggested that they should be considered subspecies of <i>T. maximus</i>, but they differ in structure, voice and the appearance of the eye-ring.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Similar_species">Similar species</span></h3>
<p>In Europe, the common blackbird can be confused with the paler-winged first-winter <span>ring ouzel</span> (<i>Turdus torquatus</i>) or the superficially similar <span>European starling</span> (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>). The <span>Sri Lankan</span> subspecies, <i>T. m. kinsii</i>, resembles the <span>Sri Lanka whistling-thrush</span> (<i>Myophonus blighi</i>) and the out-of-range <span>Tickell's thrush</span> (<i>Turdus unicolor</i>). However, the former species always has blue in the plumage, and the latter has a pale belly. A number of similar <i><span>Turdus</span></i> thrushes exist far outside the range of the common blackbird, for example the <span>South American</span> <span>Chiguanco thrush</span> (<i>Turdus chiguanco</i>). The <span>Indian blackbird</span> and the <span>Tibetan blackbird</span> were formerly considered subspecies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The common blackbird of the <span>nominate</span> subspecies <i>T. m. merula</i> is 23.5 to 29&#xA0;centimetres (9.25 to 11.4&#xA0;in) in length, has a long tail, and weighs 80&#x2013;125&#xA0;<span>grammes</span> (2.8 to 4.4&#xA0;<span>oz</span>). The adult male has glossy black <span>plumage</span>, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow <span>bill</span>. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The <span>juvenile</span> is similar to the female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The common blackbird breeds in temperate <span>Eurasia</span>, <span>North Africa</span>, the <span>Canary Islands</span>, and <span>South Asia</span>. It has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. Populations are <span>sedentary</span> in the south and west of the range, although northern birds <span>migrate</span> south as far as northern Africa and tropical Asia in winter. Urban males are more likely to <span>overwinter</span> in cooler climes than rural males, an adaptation made feasible by the warmer microclimate and relatively abundant food that allow the birds to establish territories and start reproducing earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Common over most of its range in woodland, the common blackbird has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per <span>hectare</span> (nearly three pairs per <span>acre</span>), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related <span>Ring Ouzel</span> in areas of higher altitude.</p>
<p>The common blackbird occurs up to 1000&#xA0;metres (3300&#xA0;ft) in Europe, 2300&#xA0;metres (7590&#xA0;ft) in North Africa, and at 900&#x2013;1820&#xA0;metres (3000&#x2013;6000&#xA0;ft) in peninsular India and Sri Lanka, but the large Himalayan subspecies range much higher, with <i>T. m. maximus</i> breeding at 3200&#x2013;4800&#xA0;metres (10560&#x2013;16000&#xA0;ft) and remaining above 2100&#xA0;metres (6930&#xA0;ft) even in winter.</p>
<p>This widespread species has occurred as a vagrant in many locations in Eurasia outside its normal range, but records from <span>North America</span> are normally considered to involve escapees, including, for example, the 1971 bird in <span>Quebec</span>. However, a 1994 record from <span>Bonavista, Newfoundland</span> has been accepted as a genuine wild bird, and the species is therefore on the <span>North American list</span>.</p>

<p>The male common blackbird defends its breeding territory, chasing away other males or utilising a "bow and run" threat display. This consists of a short run, the head first being raised and then bowed with the tail dipped simultaneously. If a fight between male blackbirds does occur, it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away. The female blackbird is also aggressive in the spring when it competes with other females for a good nesting territory, and although fights are less frequent, they tend to be more violent.</p>
<p>The <span>bill's</span> appearance is important in the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.</p>
<p>As long as winter food is available, both the male and female will remain in the territory throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The male common blackbird attracts the female with a courtship display which consists of oblique runs combined with head-bowing movements, an open beak, and a "strangled" low song. The female remains motionless until she raises her head and tail to permit copulation. This species is monogamous, and the established pair will usually stay together as long as they both survive. Pair separation rates of up to 20% have been noted following poor breeding. Although socially monogamous, there have been studies showing as much as 17% extra pair paternity.</p>
<p>Nominate <i>T. merula</i> may commence breeding in March, but eastern and Indian races are a month or more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August. The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as <span>ivy</span>, <span>holly</span>, <span>hawthorn</span>, <span>honeysuckle</span> or <span>pyracantha</span>. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped <span>nest</span> is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green <span>eggs</span> marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate <i>T. merula</i> are 2.9&#xD7;2.1&#xA0;centimetres (1.14&#xD7;0.93&#xA0;in) in size and weigh 7.2&#xA0;grammes (0.25&#xA0;oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe. The female incubates for 12&#x2013;14 days before the <span>altricial</span> chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10&#x2013;19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and removing faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed compared with those of other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.</p>
<p>A common blackbird has an average <span>life expectancy</span> of 2.4 years, and, based on data from <span>bird ringing</span>, the oldest recorded age is 21 years and 10 months.</p>

</table>
<p>The first-year male common blackbird of the nominate race may start singing as early as late January in fine weather in order to establish a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive <i>seee</i>, a <i>pook-pook-pook</i> alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various <i>chink</i> and <i>chook, chook</i> vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives <i>chink-chink</i> calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high <i>seee</i> alarm call for threats from <span>birds of prey</span> since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.</p>
<p>At least two subspecies, <i>T. m. merula</i> and <i>T. m. nigropileus</i>, will mimic other species of birds, cats, humans or alarms, but this is usually quiet and hard to detect.</p>

<p>The common blackbird is <span>omnivorous</span>, eating a wide range of <span>insects</span>, <span>earthworms</span>, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other <span>invertebrates</span>. Small <span>amphibians</span> and <span>lizards</span> are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect <span>caterpillars</span> and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.</p>

<p>Near human habitation the main predator of the common blackbird is the domestic <span>cat</span>, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. <span>Foxes</span> and predatory birds, such as the <span>sparrowhawk</span> and other <span>accipiters</span>, also take this species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct evidence to show that either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to <span>corvids</span>, such as the <span>European magpie</span> or <span>Eurasian jay</span>, have an impact on population numbers.</p>
<p>This species is occasionally a host of <span>parasitic</span> <span>cuckoos</span>, such as the <span>common cuckoo</span> (<i>Cuculus canorus</i>), but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its <span>non-mimetic</span> eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs. The introduced <i>merula</i> blackbird in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, lost the ability to recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.</p>
<p>As with other passerine birds, parasites are common. 88% of common blackbirds were found to have <span>intestinal parasites</span>, most frequently <i><span>Isospora</span></i> and <i><span>Capillaria</span></i> species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (<i><span>Leucocytozoon</span></i>, <i><span>Plasmodium</span></i>, <i><span>Haemoproteus</span></i> and <i><span>Trypanosoma</span></i> species).</p>
<p>Common blackbirds spend much of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with <i><span>Ixodes</span></i> ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit <span>pathogenic</span> viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit <i><span>Borrelia</span></i> bacteria to birds, there is no evidence that this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.</p>
<p>The common blackbird is one of a number of species which has <span>unihemispheric slow-wave sleep</span>. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage <span>EEG</span>, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>The common blackbird has an extensive range, estimated at 10&#xA0;million&#xA0;square kilometres (3.8&#xA0;million square miles), and a large population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span>. In the western <span>Palaearctic</span>, populations are generally stable or increasing, but there have been local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of <span>pesticides</span>, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.</p>
<p>The common blackbird was introduced to Australia by a bird dealer visiting <span>Melbourne</span> in early 1857, and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and <span>Adelaide</span> to include all of south-eastern Australia, including <span>Tasmania</span> and the <span>Bass Strait</span> islands. The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as <span>blackberry</span>, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.</p>
<p>The introduced common blackbird is, together with the native <span>silvereye</span> (<i>Zosterops lateralis</i>), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the <span>song thrush</span> (<i>Turdus philomelos</i>) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of 1,500 metres (4,921&#xA0;ft), as well as outlying islands such as the <span>Campbell</span> and <span>Kermadecs</span>. It eats a wide range of native and exotic fruit, and makes a major contribution to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds, than to <span>endemic</span> birds.</p>

<i><span>Sing a Song for Sixpence</span></i> cover illustration</div>

<p>The common blackbird was seen as a sacred though destructive bird in Classical Greek folklore, and was said to die if it consumed <span>pomegranate</span>. Like many other small birds, it has in the past been trapped in rural areas at its night roosts as an easily available addition to the diet, and in medieval times the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving may have been the origin of the familiar <span>nursery rhyme</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sing a song of sixpence,<br/>
A pocket full of rye;<br/>
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!<br/>
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing,<br/></p>
Oh wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?</blockquote>
<p>The common blackbird's melodious, distinctive song is the theme of the poem <i>Adlestrop</i> by <span>Edward Thomas</span>;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And for that minute a blackbird sang<br/></p>
<p>Close by, and round him, mistier,<br/>
Farther and farther, all the birds<br/></p>
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.</blockquote>
<p>The song is also recalled in the <span>Beatles</span> track "<span>Blackbird</span>", on which a blackbird's song is heard at the end of the track:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night,<br/>
Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br/>
All your life,<br/></p>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.</blockquote>
<p><span>Jake Thackray</span>'s "The Hair of the Widow of Bridlington" frequently compares the main character to a blackbird: "For she was wild as blackbirds are and they were in a cage" or "She fed as any blackbird would, whenever hunger came".</p>
<p>In the English <span>Christmas carol</span> <span>The Twelve Days of Christmas</span>, the line commonly sung today as "four calling birds" is believed to have originally been written in the 18th century as "four colly birds," an <span>archaism</span> meaning "black as coal" that was a popular English nickname for the common blackbird.</p>
<p>The common blackbird, unlike many black creatures, is not normally seen as a symbol of bad luck, but <span>R. S. Thomas</span> wrote that there is "a suggestion of dark Places about it", and it symbolised resignation in the 17th century <span>tragic</span> play <i><span>The Duchess of Malfi</span></i>; an alternate connotation is vigilance, the bird's clear cry warning of danger.</p>
<p>The common blackbird is the <span>national bird</span> of <span>Sweden</span>, which has a breeding population of 1&#x2013;2 million pairs, and was featured on a 30&#xA0;<span>&#xF6;re</span> <span>Christmas</span> <span>postage stamp</span> in 1970. This bird&#x2014;arguably&#x2014;also gives rise to the name of <span>Kosovo</span>, which is the possessive adjectival form of <i>kos</i> ("blackbird") as in <span>Kosovo Polje</span> ("Blackbird Field").</p>
