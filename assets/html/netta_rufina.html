<p>The <b>red-crested pochard</b> (<i>Netta rufina</i>) is a large <span>diving duck</span>. Its breeding habitat is lowland <span>marshes</span> and lakes in southern Europe and Central Asia, wintering in the <span>Indian Subcontinent</span> and Africa. It is somewhat <span>migratory</span>, and northern birds winter further south into north Africa. The adult male is unmistakable. It has a rounded orange head, red bill and black breast. The flanks are white, the back brown, and the tail black. The female is mainly a pale brown, with a darker back and crown and a whitish face. Eclipse males are like females but with red bills. They are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks, such as <span>common pochards</span>. They feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat <span>aquatic plants</span>, and typically upend for food more than most diving ducks.</p>
<p>A wheezing <i>veht</i> call can be given by the male. Series of hoarse <i>vrah-vrah-vrah</i> calls can also be heard from females.</p>
<p>Red-crested pochards build nests by the lakeside among vegetation and lay 8-12 pale green eggs. The birds' status in the <span>British Isles</span> is much confused because there have been many escapes and deliberate releases over the years, as well as natural visitors from the continent. However, it is most likely that they are escapees that are now breeding wild and have built up a successful <span>feral</span> population. They are most numerous around areas of <span>England</span> including <span>Gloucestershire</span>, <span>Oxfordshire</span> and <span>Northamptonshire</span>. The red-crested pochard is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
