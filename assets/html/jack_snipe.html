<p>The <b>jack snipe</b> (<i>Lymnocryptes minimus</i>) is a small stocky <span>wader</span>. It is the smallest <span>snipe</span>, and the <span>only member</span> of the genus <i>Lymnocryptes</i>. Features such as its sternum make it quite distinct from other snipes or <span>woodcocks</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The common name has been said to come from the <span>Welsh</span> word for a snipe, <i>giach</i> (pronounced with a hard <i>g</i>), but modern dictionaries say it comes from the masculine name <span>Jack</span>. <span>Alfred Newton</span> hypothesized that, "It may be, as in <span>Jackass</span>, an indication of sex, for it is a popular belief that the Jack-Snipe is the male of the common species; or, again, it may refer to the comparatively small size of the bird, as the 'jack' in the game of <span>bowls</span> is the smallest of the balls used, and as fishermen call the smaller <span>Pikes</span> Jacks."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Adults are smaller than <span>common snipe</span> and have relatively shorter <span>bill</span>. Length is 18&#x2013;25&#xA0;cm (7.1&#x2013;9.8&#xA0;in), wingspan is 30&#x2013;41&#xA0;cm (12&#x2013;16&#xA0;in) and weight is 33&#x2013;73&#xA0;g (1.2&#x2013;2.6&#xA0;oz). The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath. They have a dark stripe through the eye. The wings are pointed and narrow, and yellow back stripes are visible in flight. When seen, the distinctive bobbing movement, as if the <span>bird</span> is on springs, has an almost hypnotic quality.</p>
<p>The head pattern of jack snipe differs from common snipe and other species in the genus <i>Gallinago</i>, in that there is no central crown-stripe; instead, there are two pale lateral crown-stripes, which are separated from the <span>supercilium</span> by an area of dark <span>plumage</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Jack snipes are <span>migratory</span>, spending the non-breeding period in <span>Great Britain</span>, Atlantic and <span>Mediterranean</span> coastal Europe, <span>Africa</span>, and <span>India</span>. The jack snipe is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. Their breeding habitat is <span>marshes</span>, <span>bogs</span>, <span>tundra</span> and wet meadows with short vegetation in northern <span>Europe</span> and northern <span>Russia</span>.</p>

<p>Jack snipe can be secretive in their non-breeding areas and are difficult to observe, being well <span>camouflaged</span> in their habitat. Consequently, <span>birdwatchers</span> have developed a specialised technique for finding them. This involves walking through its marshy habitat until a bird is disturbed and flies up. Jack snipe will squat down and not flush from cover until an intruder is quite close. They then quietly fly a short distance before dropping back into vegetation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>They forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, also plant material.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The male performs an aerial display during courtship, during which it makes a <span>distinctive sound</span> like a galloping horse. It is silent in winter. They nest in a well-hidden location on the ground, laying 3&#x2013;4 eggs.</p>
