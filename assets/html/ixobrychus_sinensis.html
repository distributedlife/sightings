<p>The <b>yellow bittern</b> (<i>Ixobrychus sinensis</i>) is a small <span>bittern</span>. It is of Old World origins, breeding in much of the <span>Indian Subcontinent</span>, east to <span>Japan</span> and <span>Indonesia</span>. It is mainly <span>resident</span>, but some northern birds <span>migrate</span> short distances. It has been recorded as a vagrant in <span>Alaska</span> and there is a single sighting in <span>Britain</span>, from <span>Radipole Lake</span>, <span>Dorset</span> on November 23, 1962 - however, the <span>BOU</span> have always considered this occurrence to be of uncertain provenance and currently it is not accepted onto the official British List.</p>
<p>This is a small species at 36 to 38&#xA0;cm (14 to 15&#xA0;in) in length, with a short neck and longish bill. The male is uniformly dull yellow above and buff below. The head and neck are chestnut, with a black crown.</p>
<p>The female's crown, neck and breast are streaked brown, and the juvenile is like the female but heavily streaked brown below, and mottled with buff above.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is <span>reed beds</span>. They nest on platforms of reeds in shrubs. Four to six eggs are laid. They can be difficult to see, given their skulking lifestyle and reed bed habitat, but tend to fly fairly frequently, when the striking contrast between the black flight feathers and the otherwise yellowish plumage makes them unmistakable.</p>
<p>Yellow bitterns feed on <span>insects</span>, <span>fish</span> and <span>amphibians</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Protected_status">Protected status</span></h2>
<p>The yellow bittern (<i>Ixobrychus sinensis</i>) is protected under the <span>Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</span>.</p>
