<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Sombre Greenbul is a common bird, which tends to stay hidden in foliage and is more often heard than seen. It is usually found in pairs or small groups foraging for <span>insects</span>, fruit and small <span>snails</span>.</p>
<p>The Sombre Greenbul is a vocal species, and the most typical call is a monotonous, ringing phrase starting with a penetrating single whistle <i>weeeewee</i>, followed by a jumbled chortle and ending off with a rather plaintive, drawn out whistle <i>willy</i>.</p>
