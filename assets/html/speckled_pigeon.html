A speckled pigeon (<i>Columba guinea</i>) and chick in their nest.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>speckled pigeon</b> (<i>Columba guinea</i>), or <b>(African) rock pigeon,</b> is a <span>pigeon</span> that is a resident breeding bird in much of <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. It is a common and widespread species in open habitats over much of its range, although there are sizable gaps in its distribution.</p>
<p>This species builds a large stick nest in a tree and lays two white <span>eggs</span>. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings that are characteristic of pigeons in general.</p>
<p>This is a large pigeon at 41&#xA0;cm in length. Its back and wings are rufous, the latter heavily speckled with white spots. The rest of the upperparts and underparts are blue-grey, and the head is grey with red patches around the eye. The neck is brownish, streaked with white, and the legs are red. The call is a loud <i>doo-doo-doo</i>.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, but immatures are browner than adults.</p>
<p>The speckled pigeon is frequently seen around human habitation and cultivation. Most of its food is vegetable, and it gathers in large numbers where grain or groundnuts are available.</p>
