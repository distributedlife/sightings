<p>The <b>Eastern Plantain-eater</b>, <i>Crinifer zonurus</i>, also known as the <b>Eastern Grey Plantain-eater</b>, is a large member of the <span>turaco</span> family, a group of large arboreal <span>near-passerine</span> <span>birds</span> restricted to <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>This species is a resident breeder in open woodland habitats in tropical east <span>Africa</span>. It lays two or three eggs in a tree platform nest.</p>
<p>These are common, noisy and conspicuous birds, despite lacking the brilliant colours of relatives such as the <span>Violet Turaco</span>. They are 50&#xA0;cm (20&#xA0;in) long, including a long tail, and weigh 392&#x2013;737&#xA0;g (13.8&#x2013;26.0&#xA0;oz). Their plumage is mainly grey above spotted with brown. The head, erectile crest, neck and breast are brown streaked with silver. The underparts are whitish, heavily streaked with brown.</p>
<p>Eastern Plantain-eater has a thick bright yellow bill, and shows a white wing bar in flight. The sexes are identical, but immatures have a black woolly head without silver streaking.</p>
<p>This bird is similar to the closely related <span>Western Plantain-eater</span>. However, Eastern Plantain-eater has white tail bars, and lacks the chest bars and dark wing feather shafts of its western relative.</p>
<p>This species feeds on fruit, especially <span>figs</span>, and other vegetable matter.</p>
