</div>
<p>The <b>humpback whale</b> (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) is a species of <span>baleen</span> <span>whale</span>. One of the larger <span>rorqual</span> species, adults range in length from 12&#x2013;16 metres (39&#x2013;52&#xA0;ft) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000&#xA0;lb). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. An acrobatic animal known for <span>breaching</span> and slapping the water with its tail and pectorals, it is popular with <span>whale watchers</span> off the coasts of <span>Australasia</span> and the <span>Americas</span>. Males produce a complex <span>song</span> lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.</p>
<p>Found in <span>oceans</span> and <span>seas</span> around the world, humpback whales typically <span>migrate</span> up to 25,000 kilometres (16,000&#xA0;mi) each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in <span>polar</span> waters, and migrate to <span>tropical</span> or <span>subtropical</span> waters to breed and give birth in the winter. During the winter, humpbacks <span>fast</span> and live off their <span>fat</span> reserves. Their diet consists mostly of <span>krill</span> and small <span>fish</span>. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net feeding technique.</p>
<p>Like other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the <span>whaling</span> industry. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a moratorium was introduced in 1966. While stocks have since partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution continue to impact the 80,000 humpbacks worldwide.</p>

<p>Humpback whales are <span>rorquals</span> (family <span>Balaenopteridae</span>), a family that includes the <span>blue whale</span>, the <span>fin whale</span>, the <span>Bryde's whale</span>, the <span>sei whale</span> and the <span>minke whale</span>. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder <span>Mysticeti</span> as long ago as the middle <span>Miocene</span>. However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.</p>
<p>Though clearly related to the giant whales of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Balaenoptera</span></i>, the humpback has been the sole member of its genus since <span>Gray</span>'s work in 1846. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>), and possibly to the <span>gray whale</span> (<i>Eschrichtius robustus</i>), than it is to rorquals such as the minke whales. If further research confirms these relationships, it will be necessary to reclassify the rorquals.</p>
<p>The humpback whale was first identified as <i>baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre</i> by <span>Mathurin Jacques Brisson</span> in his <i><span>Regnum Animale</span></i> of 1756. In 1781, <span>Georg Heinrich Borowski</span> described the species, converting Brisson's name to its <span>Latin</span> equivalent, <i>Balaena novaeangliae</i>. In 1804, <span>Lac&#xE9;p&#xE8;de</span> shifted the humpback from the <span>Balaenidae</span> family, renaming it <i>Balaenoptera jubartes</i>. In 1846, <span>John Edward Gray</span> created the genus <i>Megaptera</i>, classifying the humpback as <i>Megaptera longipinna</i>, but in 1932, <span>Remington Kellogg</span> reverted the species names to use Borowski's <i>novaeangliae</i>. The common name is derived from the curving of their backs when diving. The generic name <i>Megaptera</i> from the <span>Greek</span> <i>mega-</i>/&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;- "giant" and <i>ptera</i>/&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1; "wing", refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means "New Englander" and was probably given by Brisson due the regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of <span>New England</span>.</p>
<p>Genetic research in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey confirmed that the separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans are far more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that these should regarded as separate subspecies of humpback whales, and that they are all evolving independently.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>A humpback whale can easily be identified by its stocky body with an obvious hump and black <span>dorsal</span> coloring. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called <span>tubercles</span>, which are <span>hair follicles</span>, and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which it lifts above the surface in some dive sequences, has wavy trailing edges. The four global populations, all under study, are: North Pacific, Atlantic, and Southern Ocean humpbacks, which have distinct populations which complete a migratory round-trip each year, and the Indian Ocean population, which does not migrate, prevented by that ocean's northern coastline.</p>
<p>The long black and white tail fin, which can be up to a third of body length, and the pectoral fins have unique patterns, which make individual whales identifiable. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any <span>cetacean</span>. The two most enduring mention the higher maneuverability afforded by long fins, and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates.</p>
<p>Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly coloured <span>baleen</span> plates on each side of their mouths. The plates measure from a mere 18 inches (46&#xA0;cm) in the front to approximately 3 feet (0.91&#xA0;m) long in the back, behind the hinge. <span>Ventral</span> grooves run from the lower jaw to the <span>umbilicus</span> about halfway along the underside of the whale. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14&#x2013;22) than in other <span>rorquals</span> but are fairly wide.</p>
<p>The stubby <span>dorsal fin</span> is visible soon after the <span>blow</span> when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a 3 metres (9.8&#xA0;ft), heart-shaped to bushy blow, or exhalation of water through the blowholes. Because humpback whales breathe voluntarily, the whales possibly shut off only half of their brains when sleeping. Early whalers also noted blows from humpback adults to be 10&#x2013;20 feet (3.0&#x2013;6.1&#xA0;m) high.</p>
<p>Newborn calves are roughly the length of their mother's head. At birth, calves measure 6 metres (20&#xA0;ft) at 2 <span>short tons</span> (1.8&#xA0;<span>t</span>) The mother, by comparison, is about 15 metres (49&#xA0;ft). They nurse for approximately six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color.</p>
<p>Females reach sexual maturity at the age of five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity at approximately seven years of age. Humpback whale lifespans range from 45&#x2013;100 years. Fully grown, the males average 13&#x2013;14&#xA0;m (43&#x2013;46&#xA0;ft). Females are slightly larger at 15&#x2013;16&#xA0;m (49&#x2013;52&#xA0;ft); one large recorded specimen was 19 metres (62&#xA0;ft) long and had pectoral fins measuring 6 metres (20&#xA0;ft) each. The largest humpback on record, according to whaling records, was killed in the Caribbean. She was 27 metres (89&#xA0;ft) long with a weight of 90 metric tons (99 short tons). Body mass typically is in the range of 25&#x2013;30 metric tons (28&#x2013;33 short tons), with large specimens weighing over 40 metric tons (44 short tons). The female has a hemispherical lobe about 15 centimetres (5.9&#xA0;in) in diameter in its genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females. The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Identifying_individuals">Identifying individuals</span></h3>
<p>The varying patterns on the tail flukes are sufficient to identify individuals. A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates, and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the <span>mark-release-recapture</span> technique (Katona and Beard 1982). A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is currently maintained by <span>College of the Atlantic</span>. Similar photographic identification projects have begun in the North Pacific by Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance and Status of Humpbacks, and around the world.</p>

<p>The humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. These whales are not excessively social in most cases. Groups may stay together a little longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps considerably with other <span>whale</span> and <span>dolphin</span> species&#x2014;for instance, the <span>minke whale</span>. However, humpbacks rarely interact socially with them, though one individual was observed playing with a <span>bottlenose dolphin</span> in <span>Hawaiian waters</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Courtship_and_reproduction">Courtship and reproduction</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote boilerplate seealso">See also: <span>Whale reproduction</span></div>
<p><span>Courtship</span> rituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward the equator from summer feeding grounds closer to the poles. Competition is usually fierce, and unrelated males, dubbed escorts by researcher <span>Louis Herman</span>, frequently trail females, as well as mother-calf dyads. Male gather into "competitive groups" and fight for females. Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive to try their luck. Behaviors include breaching, <span>spyhopping</span>, <span>lob-tailing</span>, <span>tail-slapping</span>, fin-slapping, <span>peduncle throws</span>, charging and parrying. Whale songs are assumed to have an important role in mate selection; however, they may also be used between males to establish dominance.</p>
<p>Females typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months, yet some individuals have been known to breed in two consecutive years. The peak months for birth are January, February, July, and August, with usually a one- to two&#x2013;year period between humpback births. They can live up to 48 years. Recent research on humpback <span>mitochondrial DNA</span> reveals groups living in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interspecies_interactions">Interspecies interactions</span></h4>
<p>Humpbacks, known to be a friendly species, often interact with other cetacean species such as <span>bottlenose dolphins</span>. <span>Right whales</span> are often seen to interact with humpbacks and these behaviors have been recorded in all oceans. A record of a Humpback and a <span>Southern right</span> demonstrating what was thought to be a mating behaviors was documented off the <span>Mozambique</span> coast. Humpback whales are also known to appear in mixed groups with other species, such as the <span>blue whale</span>, <span>fin whale</span>, <span>minke whale</span>, <span>gray whale</span>, and <span>sperm whale</span>. There is even an observation of a group of <span>killer whales</span> attempting to help an injured humpback whale off New Zealand coast.</p>

<p>Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex "songs" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low <span>register</span>, varying in <span>amplitude</span> and <span>frequency</span>, and typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes. Humpbacks may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. <span>Cetaceans</span> have no vocal cords, so whales generate their songs by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities.</p>
<p>Whales within a large area sing the same song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, and those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population's song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating.</p>
<p>Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale songs. Only males sing, suggesting one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an <span>echolocative</span> function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make altogether different vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.</p>
<p>Humpback whales have also been found to make a range of other social sounds to communicate, such as "grunts", "groans", "thwops", "snorts" and "barks".</p>

<p>Humpbacks feed primarily in summer and live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking <span>krill</span> and small schooling <span>fish</span> such as <span>Atlantic herring</span>, <span>Atlantic salmon</span>, <span>capelin</span>, and <span>American sand lance</span>, as well as <span>Atlantic mackerel</span>, <span>pollock</span>, and <span>haddock</span> in the North Atlantic. Krill and <span>copepods</span> have been recorded as prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.</p>

A humpback straining water through its <span>baleen</span> after <span>lunging</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The humpback has the most diverse feeding repertoire of all <span>baleen whales</span>. Its most inventive technique is known as bubble net feeding; a group of whales swims in a shrinking circle blowing bubbles below a school of prey. The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder. This ring can begin at up to 30 metres (98&#xA0;ft) in diameter and involve the cooperation of a dozen animals. Using a <span>crittercam</span> attached to a whale's back, researchers found that some whales blow the bubbles, some dive deeper to drive fish toward the surface, and others herd prey into the net by vocalizing. The whales then suddenly swim upward through the "net", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. Plated grooves in the whale's mouth allow the creature to easily drain all the water initially taken in.</p>
<p>A study published in the April 26, 2013 issue of <span>Science</span> documents a new form of bubble-net feeding called lobtail feeding among a population of whales in the Northern <span>Atlantic Ocean</span>. This technique involves the whale slapping the surface of the ocean with his tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the authors argue that the whales in this group learned the behavior socially from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.</p>
<p>Given scarring records, <span>killer whales</span> are thought to prey upon juvenile humpbacks, though this has never been witnessed. The result of these attacks is generally nothing more serious than some scarring of the skin, but young calves likely are sometimes killed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h3>
<p>Humpbacks inhabit all major oceans, in a wide band running from the Antarctic ice edge to 77&#xB0; N <span>latitude</span>, though not in the eastern <span>Mediterranean</span> or the <span>Baltic Sea</span>. They are migratory, spending summers in cooler, high-latitude waters and mating and calving in <span>tropical</span> and <span>subtropical</span> waters. An exception to this rule is a population in the <span>Arabian Sea</span>, which remains in these tropical waters year-round. Annual migrations of up to 25,000 kilometres (16,000&#xA0;mi) are typical, making it one of the mammals' best-traveled species.</p>
<p>A large population spreads across the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> every winter, ranging from the <span>island of Hawaii</span> in the south to <span>Kure Atoll</span> in the north. A 2007 study identified seven individuals wintering off the Pacific coast of <span>Costa Rica</span> as having traveled from the Antarctic&#x2014;around 8,300 kilometres (5,200&#xA0;mi). Identified by their unique tail patterns, these animals made the longest documented mammalian migration. In Australia, two main migratory populations have been identified, off the west and east coasts, respectively. These two populations are distinct, with only a few females in each <span>generation</span> crossing between the two groups.</p>
<p>South Pacific populations migrating thorough off mainland <span>New Zealand</span>, <span>Kermadec Islands</span> and <span>Tasmania</span> are increasing, but in slower speeds than in <span>Australian</span> waters because of illegal whaling by <span>Soviet Union</span> in 1970s.</p>
<p>Some re-colonizing wintering habitats are confirmed in Asia; various areas in <span>Philippines</span> such as in <span>Babuyan Islands</span> and <span>Pasaleng Bay</span>, <span>Ryukyu Islands</span>, the <span>Volcano Islands</span>, <span>Northern Mariana Islands</span>, and so on. As the populations recover, concerns of entanglements and ship strikes are increasing such as off Japanese coasts where whales began to migrate off Japanese archipelagos and into <span>Sea of Japan</span>. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span>, on <span>Kamchatka</span> coasts, and around <span>Commander Islands</span> have been studied.</p>
<p>Whales historically migrated to <span>Chinese</span> and <span>Taiwanese</span> waters around <span>Guangdong</span> coasts such as off <span>Daya Bay</span>, <span>Hong Kong</span> and <span>Leizhou Peninsula</span> to <span>Hainan Island</span> were possibly wiped out by Japanese whalers that established various whaling stations in China and on <span>Korean Peninsula</span> among with other species such as <span>Gray Whales</span> and <span>North Pacific Right Whales</span>. Whales in Korean and Chinese waters were wiped out by Japanese whalers similar to many other species such as Blue, Fin, and Gray whales.</p>

<p>Humpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century, but distinguished by whalers as early as the first decades of the 17th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean, and to a lesser extent in the <span>Indian</span> and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century introduction of the <span>explosive harpoon</span>, though, allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the <span>Antarctic Ocean</span> beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were estimated to have been taken, reducing the global population by over 90%, with North Atlantic populations estimated to have dropped to as low as 700 individuals. In 1946, the International Whaling Commission was founded to oversee the whaling industry. They imposed rules and regulations for hunting whales and set open and closed hunting seasons. To prevent <span>extinction</span>, the <span>International Whaling Commission</span> banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the population had been reduced to around 5,000. That ban is still in force.</p>
<p>Prior to commercial whaling, populations could have reached 125,000. North Pacific kills alone are estimated at 28,000. The full toll is much higher. It is now known that the Soviet Union was deliberately under-recording its catches; the Soviet catch was reported at 2,820, whereas the true number is now believed to be over 48,000.</p>
<p>As of 2004, hunting of humpback whales was restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island <span>Bequia</span> in the nation of <span>St. Vincent and the Grenadines</span>. The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its <span>JARPA II</span> research program, starting in November 2007. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the chairman of the IWC, asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the Commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed no humpback whales would be caught for the two years it would take for the IWC to reach a formal agreement.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <span>International Whaling Commission</span> authorized Greenland's native population to hunt a few humpback whales for the next three years.</p>

Humpback whale species in <span>Uramba Bah&#xED;a M&#xE1;laga National Natural Park</span>, in <span>Colombia</span>, considered the favorite place for whales to give birth to their young, making it a tourist destination</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The worldwide population is at least 80,000 humpback whales, with 18,000&#x2013;20,000 in the North Pacific, about 12,000 in the North Atlantic, and over 50,000 in the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span>, down from a pre<span>whaling</span> population of 125,000.</p>
<p>In August 2008, the IUCN changed humpback's status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered. The United States is considering listing separate humpback populations, so smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000-20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpback's extraordinary migrations, which can extend the 5,157 miles (8,299&#xA0;km) from <span>Antarctica</span> to <span>Costa Rica</span>. In Costa Rica, the <span>Ballena Marine National Park</span> is specially designed for protections of humpbacks.</p>
<p>This species is considered "least concern" from a conservation standpoint, as of 2008. This is an improvement from <span>vulnerable</span> in 1996 and <span>endangered</span> as recently as 1988. Most monitored stocks of humpback whales have rebounded well since the end of commercial whaling, such as the North Atlantic, where stocks are now believed to be approaching levels similar to those before hunting began. However, the species is considered <span>endangered</span> in some countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>Although much was learned about humpbacks from whaling, migratory patterns and social interactions were not well understood until two studies by R. Chittleborough and W. H. Dawbin in the 1960s. <span>Roger Payne</span> and <span>Scott McVay</span> made further studies of the species in 1971. Their analysis of whale songs led to worldwide media interest and convinced the public that whales were highly <span>intelligent</span>, aiding the antiwhaling advocates.</p>
<p>The Calambokidis et al 2001 report provided the "first quantitative assessment of the migratory structure of humpback whales in the entire North Pacific basin."</p>
<p>The United States initiated a status review of the species on August 12, 2009, and is seeking public comment on potential changes to the species listing under the <span>Endangered Species Act</span>. Areas where population data are limited and the species may be at higher risk include the <span>Arabian Sea</span>, the western North Pacific Ocean, the west coast of Africa and parts of <span>Oceania</span>.</p>
<p>The U. S. Department of Commerce's commissioned 2008 report entitled "SPLASH: Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance and Status of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific," noted that there are many challenges to determining the recovery of the previously over-harvested population of the Humpback Whale (North Pacific) because of the lack of accurate abundance estimates, the unexpected complexity of the structure of whale populations and their migratory movements between feeding and wintering areas. According to the 2008 SPLASH report, which was based on data collected between 2004 to 2006, there were between about 18,302 Humpback Whales in the entire North Pacific (Splash 2008:2-3). The SPLASH estimate is consistent with a moderate rate of recovery for a depleted population (SPLASH 2008:3) although it also considered to be a "dramatic increase in abundance" from other postwhaling period estimates" (post-1960s. In comparison to the estimate of 9,819 in the Calambokidis et al 1997 report covering the period 1991-1993 this represents a four percent increase in population from 1993 to 2006 (SPLASH 2008:3).</p>
<p>Off the west coast of Canada, the <span>Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve</span> which covers 3,400 square kilometres, is "a primary feeding habitat" of the Humpback Whale (North Pacific population) protected by Canada&#x2019;s <span>Species at Risk Act</span> (SARA). Humpback Whale's critical habitat off the coast of British Columbia overlaps with tankers shipping route between Canada and its eastern trade partners. In 2005 the Humpback Whale (North Pacific population) was listed as threatened under Canada&#x2019;s Species at Risk Act (SARA). In April 19, 2014 the Department of the Environment recommended an amendment to (SARA) to downgrade the status of the Humpback Whale off the coast of British Columbia from &#x201C;threatened&#x201D; to &#x201C;species of special concern.&#x201D; According to <span>Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)</span>, the Humpback Whale (North Pacific population) has been increasing at about four per cent each year from 1992 to 2008. Although socio-economic costs and benefits were considered in their decision to downgrade the status of the whales, according to the University of British Columbia&#x2019;s North Pacific Universities <span>Marine Mammal Research Consortium</span>'s research director, the decision was based on biology not politics.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, among other countries, designated the humpback as a priority species under the national <span>Biodiversity Action Plan</span>. The sanctuary provided by US <span>National Parks</span>, such as <span>Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve</span> and <span>Cape Hatteras National Seashore</span>, among others, have also become major factors in sustaining populations.</p>
<p>Today, individuals are vulnerable to collisions with ships, <span>entanglement</span> in fishing gear, and noise pollution. Like other <span>cetaceans</span>, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.</p>
<p><span>Saxitoxin</span>, a <span>paralytic shellfish poisoning</span> from contaminated mackerel has been implicated in humpback whale deaths.</p>

<p>Humpback whales are generally curious about objects in their environments. Some individuals, referred to as "friendlies", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes. Because humpbacks are often easily approachable, curious, easily identifiable as individuals, and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of <span>whale-watching</span> tourism in many locations around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of "ecotourism" to use the species without killing them. This whale-watching business brings in a revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migaloo">Migaloo</span></h3>

<p>An <span>albino</span> humpback whale that travels up and down the east coast of Australia became famous in the local media on account of its extremely rare, all-white appearance. Migaloo is the only known all-white humpback whale  and is known to be a true albino. First sighted in 1991, and believed to be three to five years old at that time, Migaloo was named for an <span>indigenous Australian</span> word for "white fella". Migaloo was shown to be male in 2004 by analysis of sloughed skin samples. Because of the intense interest, environmentalists feared he was becoming distressed by the number of boats following him each day. In response, the Queensland and New South Wales governments introduce legislation each year to create a 500&#xA0;m (1600-ft) exclusion zone around the whale.</p>

<p>Humphrey the Whale was twice rescued by <span>The Marine Mammal Center</span> and other concerned groups in <span>California</span>. In 1985, Humphrey swam into <span>San Francisco Bay</span> and then up the <span>Sacramento River</span> towards <span>Rio Vista</span>. Five years later, Humphrey returned and became stuck on a <span>mudflat</span> in San Francisco Bay immediately north of <span>Sierra Point</span> below the view of onlookers from the upper floors of the <span>Dakin Building</span>. He was pulled off the mudflat with a large <span>cargo net</span> and the help of the Coast Guard. Both times, he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a "sound net" in which people in a flotilla of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known as <i>oikami</i>. At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean. After leaving San Francisco Bay in 1990, Humphrey was seen only once, at the <span>Farallon Islands</span> in 1991.</p>
