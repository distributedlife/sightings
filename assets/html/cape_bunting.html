<p>The <b>Cape Bunting</b> (<i>Emberiza capensis</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>bunting</span> family Emberizidae.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>There are a dozen subspecies, differing in plumage, but all have the distinctive head pattern and rufous in the wings. The northeastern race <i>E. c. vincenti</i> is very dark above, and slaty below. It has reduced chestnut on the wing coverts. It is now usually raised to species status as <span>Vincent's Bunting</span>, <i>Emberiza vincenti</i>, however some taxonomists still consider it to be conspecific.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Bunting is 16&#xA0;cm long. The adult has a black crown, white <span>supercilium</span> and black-bordered white ear coverts. The upperparts are grey brown with some dark streaks, and the wing coverts are chestnut. The tail is darker chestnut, and the underparts are grey with a pale throat. The sexes are very similar, but females may have a buff tone to the white head markings. Young birds have duller chestnut wings, a less distinct head pattern, and heavier streaking extending on to the breast and flanks. The call is an ascending <i>zzoo-zeh-zee-zee</i>. The song is a loud chirping <i>chup chup chup chup chee chhep chu</i>. <i>E. c. vincenti</i> has a simple <i>tre-re-ret tre-re-ret</i> song.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Bunting occurs in southern <span>Africa</span> from southwestern <span>Angola</span>, eastern <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and southern <span>Tanzania</span> to the <span>Cape</span>. Its habitat is rocky slopes and dry weedy scrub, mainly in mountains in the north of its range. It previously utilized stony arid areas with some short grass, but much of this has been lost to ploughing.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Bunting is not gregarious, and is normally seen alone, in pairs or family groups. It feeds on the ground on seeds, insects and spiders. Its lined cup nest is built low in a shrub or tussock. The 2-4 eggs are cream and marked with red-brown and lilac.</p>
