<p>The <b>Antarctic tern</b> (<i>Sterna vittata</i>) is a typical tern. It ranges throughout the southern oceans. It is very similar in appearance to the closely related <span>Arctic tern</span>, but is stockier, and the wing tips are grey instead of blackish in flight. It is, of course, in breeding <span>plumage</span> in the southern summer, when the Arctic tern has moulted to its non-breeding plumage (though this is not useful for separating it from another species, the <span>South American tern</span>).</p>
<p>Breeding takes place from mid-November to early December. Chicks hatch from December to February. <span>Skuas</span> and jaegers are the primary predators of this bird's eggs and young.</p>
<p>The total global population of this bird is around 140,000 individuals.</p>
