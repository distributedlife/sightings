<p>The <b>slender-billed prion</b> or <b>thin-billed prion</b>, <i>Pachyptila belcheri</i>, is a species of <span>seabird</span> in the <span>Procellariidae</span> family. It is found in the southern <span>oceans</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The slender-billed prion is a member of the <span>Pachyptila</span> <span>genus</span> and along with the <span>blue petrel</span> make up the <span>prions</span>. They are then members of the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>, and they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Pachyptila</i>, the word, comes from the <span>Greek</span> words <i>pakhus</i> and <i>ptilon</i>. <i>Pakhus</i> means <b>thick</b> or <b>stout</b> and <i>ptilon</i> means <b>a feather</b>. Also from the Greek language, <i>prion</i> comes from the word <i>pri&#x14D;n</i> meaning <b>a saw</b>, which is in reference to its serrated edges of its <span>bill</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Like all prions, they are blue-grey above and white below with a dark "M" on their back to their wingtips. They have a white eyebrow and a dark line extending from below the eye almost to the neck. Their tail is wedge-shaped and grey with a black tip, their <span>bill</span> is blue-grey, and their feet are pale blue.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>They are annual breeders and will lay one <span>egg</span>. Both parents will then <span>incubate</span> the egg and care for the young until they <span>fledge</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h2>
<p>Like all prions, the slender-billed eat <span>zooplankton</span>, by filtering it through their bill.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The slender-billed prion spends all of his non-breeding time over ocean water in the southern <span>oceans</span>. When breeding, they will do so on the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, the <span>Falkland islands</span> and <span>Noir Island</span> off the coast of southern <span>Chile</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>This species has a very large range and their estimated population is 7,000,000, allowing the <span>IUCN</span> to classify them as <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
