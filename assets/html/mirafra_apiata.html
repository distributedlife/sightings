<p>The <b>Cape Clapper Lark</b> (<i>Mirafra apiata</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> which breeds in southern <span>Africa</span>. It derives its name from the wing clapping which forms part of the display flight.</p>
<p>It was previously considered conspecific with the <span>Eastern Clapper Lark</span>.</p>
<p>The <b>Cape Clapper Lark</b>, <i>Mirafra (apiata) apiata</i>, is found in southwestern <span>South Africa</span>, the <b>Agulhas Clapper Lark</b>, <i>M. (a.) majoriae</i>, in found in the southern <span>Western Cape Province</span> of South Africa as far east as <span>Knysna</span>.</p>
<p>Fry, Keith and Urban, in <i>The Birds of Africa</i>, regard M. apiata and the Eastern Clapper Lark as forming a superspecies with <i>M. rufocinnamomea</i>, the <span>Flappet Lark</span>, which is found further north.</p>
<p>The Cape Clapper Lark is a species of open grassland and savanna, also inhabiting <span>karoo</span>, <span>fynbos</span> and fallow agricultural land.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>This <span>lark</span> is a 15&#xA0;cm long bird, with a brown crown, rich rufous underparts, and a strong bill. Cape Clapper Lark has grey upperparts and a grey face, and Agulhas Clapper Lark has dark brown upperparts, although individual variation means that it cannot always be reliably distinguished from the nominate race.</p>
<p>The display commences with an ascending flight with wing flapping. Cape Clapper Lark has a slower wing clap compared to Eastern Clapper Lark, and its otherwise similar call is longer and rises in pitch more. Agulhas Clapper Lark has a fast wing clap, and a descending double whistled <i>peeeooo</i> call.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Clapper Lark is a <span>skulking</span> species, difficult to find when not displaying. It is not gregarious, and individuals tend to be seen in dry habitats feeding on the ground on seeds and insects.</p>
