<p>The <b>banded martin</b> or <b>banded sand martin</b> (<i>Riparia cincta</i>) is a small passerine bird in the <i>swallow</i> family.</p>
<p>The banded martin is found in open habitats such as farmland, grassland and savannah, usually near water. It breeds across <span>Africa</span> from <span>Cameroon</span> and <span>Zaire</span> to <span>Ethiopia</span> south to the Cape in <span>South Africa</span>, although it is absent from the driest regions of western South Africa and southern <span>Namibia</span>. The southern nominate subspecies of South Africa and <span>Zimbabwe</span>, is <span>migratory</span>, wintering further north, particularly in the west, where it can move sometimes as far as <span>Gambia</span>. <i>R. c. xerica</i> also leaves its drier breeding grounds in <span>Botswana</span> and northern Namibia in the southern winter. Other subspecies undertake local or altitudinal movements often dependent on the rainfall pattern.</p>
<p>The banded martin, unlike the other members of its genus, is not colonial in its nesting habits. Its nest is at the end of a 60&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm long tunnel usually excavated by the birds in a natural sand bank or earth mound. The actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow. Two to five white eggs are the normal clutch, and are incubated by both parents.</p>
<p>The 15&#x2013;17&#xA0;cm long banded martin has earth-brown upper parts, except for a white stripe above the eye. Its underparts are white, as are the underwing coverts, and it has a dark brown breast band, and sometimes a thin dark line across the vent. Sexes are similar, but the young have a paler breast band and golden tips to the upper part feathers.</p>
<p>It is the largest <i>Riparia</i> species It is easily distinguished from the smaller <span>sand martin</span> by its square tail and white on the underwings, and from the <span>brown-throated sand martin</span> by its white throat. It is less gregarious than those species, and is typically seen in pairs or small flocks.</p>
<p>There are a number of subspecies differing in size and the plumage tones of the upper parts or breast band. Nominate <i>R. c. cincla</i> of southern Africa is the palest form.</p>
<p>This species has a slow erratic flight and frequently perches. Its diet consists of <span>insects</span>, usually taken in flight over grassland. The flight call is <i>che-che-che</i>, and the song is a twittering jumble of <i>chip choop</i> sounds.</p>
