<p>The <b>tawny eagle</b> (<i>Aquila rapax</i>) is a large <span>bird of prey</span>. Like all <span>eagles</span>, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. It was once considered to be closely related to the <span>migratory</span> <span>steppe eagle</span>, <i>Aquila nipalensis</i>, and the two forms have previously been treated as conspecific. They were split based on pronounced differences in morphology and anatomy; two molecular studies, each based on a very small number of genes, indicate that the species are distinct but disagree over how closely related they are.</p>
<p>It breeds in most of <span>Africa</span> both north and south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span> and across tropical southwestern <span>Asia</span> to <span>India</span>. It is a resident breeder which lays 1&#x2013;3 <span>eggs</span> in a <span>stick nest</span> in a tree, crag or on the ground.</p>
<p>Throughout its <span>range</span> it favours open dry <span>habitats</span>, such as <span>desert</span>, semi-desert, <span>steppes</span>, or <span>savannah</span>, plains.</p>

<p>This is a large <span>eagle</span> although it is one of the smaller species in the <i><span>Aquila</span></i> genus. It is 60&#x2013;75&#xA0;cm (24&#x2013;30&#xA0;in) in length and has a wingspan of 159&#x2013;190&#xA0;cm (63&#x2013;75&#xA0;in). Weight can range from 1.6 to 3&#xA0;kg (3.5 to 6.6&#xA0;lb). It has tawny upperparts and blackish flight feathers and tail. The lower back is very pale. This species is smaller and paler than the Steppe Eagle, although it does not share that species' pale throat.</p>
<p>Immature birds are less contrasted than adults, but both show a range of variation in <span>plumage</span> colour.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The tawny eagle's diet is largely fresh <span>carrion</span> of all kinds, but it will kill small <span>mammals</span> up to the size of a <span>rabbit</span>, <span>reptiles</span> and birds up to the size of <span>guineafowl</span>. It will also steal food from other raptors.</p>
<p>The call of the tawny eagle is a <span>crow</span>-like barking, but it is rather a silent bird except in display.</p>
