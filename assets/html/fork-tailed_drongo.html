<p>The <b>fork-tailed drongo</b>, also called the <b>common drongo</b>, <b>African drongo</b>, or <b>savanna drongo</b> (<i>Dicrurus adsimilis</i>), is a <span>drongo</span>, a type of small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of the Old World tropics. The species was earlier considered to cover Asia, but the Asian species is now called the <span>black drongo</span> (<i>Dicrurus macrocercus</i>). They are members of the family <span>Dicruridae</span>.</p>
<p>The fork-tailed drongo is a common and widespread resident breeder in <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. These <span>insect</span>-eating birds are usually found in open forests or bush. Two to four <span>eggs</span> are laid in a cup nest in a fork high in a tree.</p>
<p>These are aggressive and fearless birds, given their small size, and will attack much larger species, including <span>birds of prey</span> if their nest or young are threatened.</p>
<p>The male is mainly glossy black, although the wings are duller. It is large-headed and has the forked tail which gives the species its name. The female is similar but less glossy. The bill is black and heavy, and the eye is red.</p>
<p>The fork-tailed drongo is 25&#xA0;cm long. It has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a <span>shrike</span>. It flycatches or take prey from the ground and is attracted to bush fires.</p>
<p>The call is a metallic <i>strink-strink</i>. The fork-tailed drongo in Africa are capable of using deceptive mimicked alarm calls to steal food from birds and animals such as meerkats.</p>
<p>The subspecies <i>D. a. modestus</i> (<span>Pr&#xED;ncipe</span>) together with <i>D. a. coracinus</i> and <i>D. a. atactus</i> (<span>Bioko</span> and mainland west and central <span>Africa</span> from <span>Guinea</span> east to western <span>Kenya</span> and south to <span>Angola</span>) is usually split as a separate species, the <b><span>velvet-mantled drongo</span></b> <i>D. modestus</i>, (<span>Hartlaub</span>, 1849).</p>

<p>Observations show that the fork-tailed drongo in Africa are capable of using deceptive mimicked alarm calls to steal food from birds like pied <span>babblers</span> and animals such as meerkats. Tom Flower observed that fork-tailed drongos spend a quarter of their time following other animals. Sometimes when a predator is approaching, drongos act as sentries and warn their neighbours with genuine alarm calls. But drongos also earn quarter of their daily calories by sounding a false alarm, as in <span>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</span>, when the other animal finds food. When the meerkats and babblers flee from the non-existent predator, drongo steals their food.</p>
