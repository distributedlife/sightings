<p>The <b>crowned hornbill</b> (<i>Tockus alboterminatus</i>) is an African <span>hornbill</span>. It is a medium-sized bird, 50&#x2013;54 centimetres (20&#x2013;21&#xA0;in) in length, and is characterized by its white belly and black back and wings. The tips of the long tail feathers are white. The eyes are yellow; the beak is red and presents a stocky <span>casque</span> on the upper mandible. In females, the casque is smaller. The crowned hornbill can be distinguished from the similar <span>Bradfield's hornbill</span> by its shorter beak.</p>
<p>The crowned hornbill is a common resident of the coastal and riverine forests of southern (only the eastern coast) to northeastern Africa. It forages mainly in trees, where it feeds on <span>insects</span> (often caught in flight), small <span>rodents</span>, small reptiles, seeds and fruits. This hornbill species can be seen in flocks, usually in the dry season. Four to five white eggs are incubated for 25 to 30 days; the juveniles remain with both parents for about 8 weeks.</p>
