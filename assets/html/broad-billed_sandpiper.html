<p>The <b>broad-billed sandpiper</b> (<i>Limicola falcinellus</i>) is a small <span>wading</span> <span>bird</span>. It is the <span>only member</span> of the <span>genus</span> <i>Limicola</i>; some have proposed that it should be placed in the genus <i>Erolia</i> with the "<span>stint</span>" sandpipers, but more recent research (Thomas <i>et al.</i>, 2004) suggests that it should rather go into the genus <i>Philomachus</i> with the <span>ruff</span> and possibly the <span>sharp-tailed sandpiper</span>; it certainly is a fairly unusual <span>calidrid</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Broad-billed sandpipers are small waders, slightly smaller than the dunlin, but with a longer straighter <span>bill</span>, and shorter legs. The breeding adult has patterned dark grey upperparts and white underparts with blackish markings on the breast. It has a pale crown stripe and supercilia.</p>
<p>In the boreal winter, they are pale grey above and white below, like a winter dunlin, but retaining the head pattern. Juveniles have backs, similar to young dunlin, but the white flanks and belly and brown-streaked breast are distinctive.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The broad-billed sandpiper is strongly <span>migratory</span>, spending the non-breeding season from easternmost <span>Africa</span>, through south and south-east <span>Asia</span> to <span>Australasia</span>. It is highly gregarious, and will form flocks with other calidrid waders, particularly <span>dunlins</span>. Despite its European breeding range, this species is rare on passage in western Europe, presumably because of the south-easterly <span>migration</span> route.</p>
<p>This bird's breeding habitat is wet <span>taiga</span> bogs in Arctic northern <span>Europe</span> and <span>Siberia</span>. The male performs an aerial display during courtship. They nest in a ground scrape, laying 4 <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>They forage in soft mud on marshes and the coast, mainly picking up food by sight. They mostly eat <span>insects</span> and other small invertebrates.</p>
<p>The broad-billed sandpiper is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
