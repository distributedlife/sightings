<p><b>Oribi</b> (<i>Ourebia ourebi</i>, known as <i>oorbietjie</i> in <span>Afrikaans</span>) are graceful slender-legged, long-necked small <span>antelope</span> found in grassland almost throughout sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Oribi grow to around 92&#x2013;110&#xA0;cm (36 to 43&#xA0;in) in length, with a shoulder height of 50&#x2013;66&#xA0;cm (20 to 26&#xA0;in) and weigh an average of 12&#x2013;22&#xA0;kg (26 to 49&#xA0;lb). They can run at speeds of up to 40&#x2013;50&#xA0;km/h (25&#x2013;31&#xA0;mph). In captivity, they have lifespans of up to 14 years.</p>
<p>The back and upper chest is yellow to orange-brown. The chin, throat, chest, belly and rump are white. The tail is short and bushy, the upper side black or dark brown, and the under surface white. The white, crescent-shaped band of fur above the eye helps to distinguish this species from other similar-looking antelope. Below each ear is a large, round, black, glandular patch, the nostrils are prominently red, and on the sides of the face are vertical creases that house the <span>preorbital glands</span>. These glands produce an odorous secretion used to mark the oribi's territory. Only males grow horns, which are slender and upright, ridged to about halfway up, the ends being smooth and pointed, with some of length 19&#xA0;cm (7.5&#xA0;in) being recorded.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Oribi are found in most countries throughout <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>, ranging from <span>Senegal</span> to west and central <span>Ethiopia</span> and southern <span>Somalia</span>, southward into eastern <span>Kenya</span>, across into north <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, and <span>Angola</span>, with patchy and discontinuous distribution through <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and into central and eastern <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>They typically inhabit open grasslands or thinly bushed country, preferring habitats with short grasses on which to graze, interspersed with tall grasses which provide cover from predators and the elements. Oribi are highly water-dependent and tend to avoid steep slopes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>During the breeding season, August to December, the male will mate with all the females which share his territory. Usually, only one or two females are present in each territory. Following a <span>gestation period</span> of six to seven months, a single offspring is born. For the first eight to 10 weeks the female oribi hides her young in thick grass, where it will lie motionless if approached. The mother returns periodically to suckle her offspring. Young are weaned at about four to five months. Females reach sexual maturity at 10 months, males at 14 months.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>Primarily grazers, oribi prefer to eat short grasses, but will browse on leaves, foliage and young shoots during the dry season. They are often seen in burnt areas after <span>veld fires</span>, returning to the area to eat the fresh grass shoots. The oribi also use <span>mineral licks</span> to supplement their diets.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Predators">Predators</span></h2>
<p>Oribi fall prey to numerous animals, including <span>lions</span>, <span>leopards</span>, <span>caracals</span>, <span>hyenas</span>, <span>African wild dogs</span>, <span>jackals</span>, <span>crocodiles</span> and <span>pythons</span>. Young are also taken by <span>eagles</span>, <span>genets</span> and other small carnivores.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Oribi are found on their own, in pairs, or in small groups of one male with two or more females. Resting during the heat of the day, oribi are most active in the morning, late afternoon and evening. When alarmed, they produce a shrill whistle. Often, they do not attempt to flee until an intruder is within a few meters, remaining motionless in the grass, relying on camouflage. If threatened, they gallop away, bounding stiff-legged into the air every few strides; a behaviour known as <span>stotting</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats_and_conservation">Threats and conservation</span></h2>
<p>Oribi populations in many areas are threatened by human activities, such as:</p>

<p>Oribi occur in several protected areas and are the subject of a <span>WWF Species Project</span>. This project aims to track captive-bred oribi after their release into appropriate habitat to research their home ranges and habitat preferences. The long-term aim of the project is to establish viable wild populations from captive-bred stock.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h2>
<p>These subspecies have been described:<br/></p>

<p>Two of these subspecies are listed on the <span>IUCN Red List</span>: Haggard's oribi (<i>O. o. haggardi</i>) is classified as Vulnerable (Vu C1) and the <span>Kenya oribi</span> (<i>O. o. kenyae</i>) is classified as Extinct.</p>
