<p>The <b>Grey Kestrel</b> (<i>Falco ardosiaceus</i>) is an <span>African</span> <span>bird of prey</span> belonging to the <span>falcon</span> family <span>Falconidae</span>. Its closest relatives are the <span>Banded Kestrel</span> and <span>Dickinson's Kestrel</span> and the three are sometimes placed in the <span>subgenus</span> <i>Dissodectes</i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a fairly small, stocky <span>kestrel</span> with a large, flat-topped head and fairly short wings that don't reach past the tip of the tail when at rest. It is 28&#x2013;33&#xA0;cm long with a wingspan of 58&#x2013;72&#xA0;cm and a weight of up to 300 grams. The female is 4-11% larger and 5-11% heavier than the male. The <span>plumage</span> of the adult is uniformly dark grey apart from darker wingtips, faint dark streaking on the body and slightly barred <span>flight feathers</span>. The feet and <span>cere</span> are yellow and there is bare yellow skin around the eye. The most similar species is the <span>Sooty Falcon</span> which has a more rounded head, long wings extending past the tail and less yellow around the eye.</p>
<p><span>Juvenile</span> Grey Kestrels are browner than the adults with a greenish cere and greenish around the eye. Juvenile Dickinson's Kestrels are similar but have a barred tail and a more strongly barred underwing.</p>
<p>The Grey Kestrel is generally silent outside the breeding season but has a shrill, chattering call and a rattling whistle.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_range">Habitat and range</span></h2>
<p>It inhabits <span>savannas</span>, open woodland and forest clearings. It favours areas with <span>palm trees</span>, especially near water. It often perches on exposed branches, telegraph poles and wires.</p>
<p>It is widespread in <span>West</span> and <span>Central Africa</span> but is absent from densely forested regions including parts of the <span>Congo Basin</span>. Its range extends east to <span>Ethiopia</span> and western parts of <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. In the south it reaches northern parts of <span>Namibia</span> and <span>Zambia</span> and <span>vagrants</span> have appeared in <span>Malawi</span>. The total range covers about 12 million km&#xB2;. In West Africa there is some movement northward in the <span>wet season</span> and southward in the <span>dry season</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It is a <span>crepuscular</span> bird, most active at dawn and dusk. It generally hunts from a high perch but occasionally hovers. It feeds mainly on <span>insects</span>, <span>lizards</span> and small <span>mammals</span> such as <span>bats</span> but will also take birds, <span>amphibians</span> and <span>worms</span>. Prey is usually caught on the ground. It will sometimes feed on <span>oil palm</span> nuts, one of the few birds of prey to eat vegetable matter.</p>
<p>Breeding occurs from March to June in the north of its range and from August to December in the south. Courting pairs perform mutual soaring displays. The <span>eggs</span> are usually laid in the <span>nest</span> of a <span>Hamerkop</span>; most often an unoccupied nest but occasionally Hamerkops will be forced out. Sometimes the kestrels will use the nest of another bird or a hole in a tree. There are two to five eggs in a clutch. They are whitish with reddish or brown markings and are <span>incubated</span> for 26&#x2013;31 days. The young birds <span>fledge</span> after about 30 days.</p>
