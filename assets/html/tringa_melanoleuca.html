<p>The <b>greater yellowlegs</b> (<i>Tringa melanoleuca</i>) is a large <span>North American</span> <span>shorebird</span>, similar in appearance to the smaller <span>lesser yellowlegs</span>. Its closest relative, however, is the <span>greenshank</span>, which together with the <span>spotted redshank</span> form a close-knit group. Among them, these three species show all the basic leg and foot colors found in the <span>shanks</span>, demonstrating that this character is <span>paraphyletic</span> (Pereira &amp; Baker, 2005). They are also the largest shanks apart from the <span>willet</span>, which is altogether more robustly built. The greater yellowlegs and the greenshank share a coarse, dark, and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage.</p>
<p>Adults have long yellow legs and a long, thin, dark bill which has a slight upward curve and is longer than the head. The body is grey-brown on top and white underneath; the neck and breast are streaked with dark brown. The rump is white. It ranges in length from 29 to 40&#xA0;cm (11 to 16&#xA0;in) and in weight from 111 to 250&#xA0;g (3.9 to 8.8&#xA0;oz).</p>

<p>Their breeding habitat is bogs and marshes in the <span>boreal forest</span> region of <span>Canada</span> and <span>Alaska</span>. They nest on the ground, usually in well-hidden locations near water. The three to four eggs average 50&#xA0;mm (2.0&#xA0;in) in length and 33&#xA0;mm (1.3&#xA0;in) in breadth and weigh about 28&#xA0;g (0.99&#xA0;oz). The incubation period is 23 days. The young leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching and then leave the vicinity of the nest within two days.</p>
<p>They <span>migrate</span> to the <span>Atlantic</span> and <span>Pacific</span> coasts of the <span>United States</span> and south to <span>South America</span>. They are very rare vagrants to western <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>These birds forage in shallow water, sometimes using their bills to stir up the water. They mainly eat insects and small fish, as well as crustaceans and marine worms. It often walks in sand or mud and leaves clear <span>tracks</span>; it can be possible to gather information about this species using its tracks.</p>
<p>The call is harsher than that of the lesser yellowlegs.</p>
