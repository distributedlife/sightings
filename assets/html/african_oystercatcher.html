<p>The <b>African oystercatcher</b> or <b>African black oystercatcher</b> (<i>Haematopus moquini</i>), is a large charismatic <span>wader</span> resident to the mainland <span>coasts</span> and offshore <span>islands</span> of <span>southern Africa</span>. This near-threatened <span>oystercatcher</span> has a population of over 6,000 adults, which breed between November and April. The <span>scientific name</span> <i>moquini</i> commemorates the French naturalist <span>Alfred Moquin-Tandon</span> who discovered and named this species before <span>Bonaparte</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The African oystercatcher is a large, noisy <span>wader</span>, with completely black <span>plumage</span>, red legs and a strong broad red <span>bill</span>. The sexes are similar in appearance, however, females are larger and have a slightly longer beak than males. Juveniles have soft grey plumage and do not express the characteristic red legs and beak until after they fledged. The <span>call</span> is a distinctive loud piping, very similar to <span>Eurasian oystercatchers</span>. As the Eurasian oystercatcher is a <span>migratory</span> species they only occur as a <span>vagrant</span> in southern Africa, and its black-and-white plumage makes confusion impossible.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_Habitat">Distribution and Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The African oystercatcher is native to the mainland coasts and offshore islands of <span>Southern Africa</span> sometimes occurring as a vagrant in Angola and Mozambique. Its breeding range extends from <span>L&#xFC;deritz</span>, Namibia to <span>Mazeppa Bay</span>, Eastern Cape, South Africa. There are estimated to be over 6,000 adult birds in total.</p>
<p>Typically sedentary African oystercatchers rarely leave their territories, which include a nesting site and feeding grounds. These will usually be located on or near <span>rocky shores</span> where they can feed.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits">Habits</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>African oystercatchers predominantly feed on <span>molluscs</span> such as <span>mussels</span> and <span>limpets</span>, although are known to also feed on <span>polychaetes</span>, <span>insects</span> and potentially even <span>fish</span>. They are adapted to pry open mussels and loosen limpets off the rocks but have been recorded picking through sand to locate other food items.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The <span>nest</span> is a bare scrape on pebbles, sand or shingle within about 30 metres (98&#xA0;ft) of the high-water mark. On rock ledges there may be a rim of shells to keep the eggs in place. The female generally lays two <span>eggs</span>, but there may be one or three, which are incubated by both adults. The incubation period varies between 27 and 39 days and the young take a further 38 or so days to fledge. Breeding success is greater on offshore islands where there are few predators and less disturbance than mainland sites.</p>
<p>The eggs average about 65&#xA0;mm (2.6&#xA0;in) long, ranging from 45 to 73&#xA0;mm (1.8 to 2.9&#xA0;in), and have a breadth of 41&#xA0;mm (1.6&#xA0;in), ranging from 34 to 45&#xA0;cm (13 to 18&#xA0;in).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Longevity_and_mortality">Longevity and mortality</span></h3>
<p>The lifespan of an African oystercatcher is about 35 years, of which they are known to pair up for 25 years. Although adults are rarely predated most mainland egg and chick fatalities are due to disturbance by people, off-road vehicles, dog attacks and <span>predation</span> by the <span>kelp gull</span> <i>(Larus dominicanus)</i> and other avian preditors. Off shore pairs experience similar avian predation although most chicks perish due to starvation.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The <span>IUCN</span> lists the African oystercatcher as being "<span>Near Threatened</span>". The population trend seems to be upward as the local community becomes more involved in adopting conservation measures. The current Red Data list (2014) under construction lists the species as Least Concern, once this is published this link will be updated.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_Research">Current Research</span></h2>
<p>Ongoing research is being undertaken for this species on the migration of young. If you happen to see an oystercatcher with coloured or numbered bands on their legs take note of the numbers and colours and contact the <span>ADU</span> or <span>Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology</span> with the information. If an adult is found dead with metal rings please let <span>SAFRING</span> know the details.</p>
