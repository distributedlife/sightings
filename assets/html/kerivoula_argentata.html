<p>The <b>Damara woolly bat</b> (<i>Kerivoula argentata</i>) is a <span>nocturnal</span> insectivorous species of <span>vesper bat</span> in the Vespertilionidae family found in Africa. This species typically has reddish brown fur on its back and white fur on its abdomen. Its natural <span>habitat</span> is moist <span>savanna</span>, although it has also been shown to inhabit woodlands and coastal forests. These bats typically weight about 10&#xA0;g, and have a low <span>aspect ratio</span>, as well as low <span>wing loading</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>These bats typically have a rich brown mixed with grizzled silver coat of hair on top and grey or whitish hair underneath. The ears are proportionally large compared to their size and have rounded tips. They typically weigh between 6 and 9 g and are between 8.3 and 10&#xA0;cm long, with an average wingspan of 25&#xA0;cm. A feature relatively unique to <i>K. argentata</i> is the fringe of hair on the outer edge of <span>interfemoral membrane</span> which stretches between its legs, as this hair is distinctive to this species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Echolocation">Echolocation</span></h2>
<p>The echolocation for this species is a relatively low-intensity call that lasts about two milliseconds with a low frequency peak of around 90-118 hertz. These properties allow the bats to come as close as 3 m to its prey before the calls are detectable.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>As with several other <i><span>Kerivoula</span></i> species, the Damara woolly bat uses abandoned nests of weaverbirds and the <span>scarlet-chested sunbird</span>. Typically, the bats roost alone, but colonies can reach up to six members. The range of the bats extends across much of sub-Saharan Africa and has been identified in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Cote d'Ivoire</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Senegal</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>.</p>
