<p>The <b>Providence petrel</b> (<i>Pterodroma solandri</i>) is a species that <span>burrows</span> in one location; isolated <span>Lord Howe Island</span>, some 800&#xA0;km from the <span>Australian</span> mainland in the <span>Tasman Sea</span>.</p>
<p>Of roughly <span>pigeon</span> like proportions (40&#xA0;cm), the bird was once also numerous on <span>Norfolk Island</span>. However, its population there was consumed by starving <span>transportees</span>, sent to Norfolk Island as way of punishment. Nonetheless it numbers some 100,000 on Lord Howe Island. Graceful and supple in flight, the providence petrel has a cumbersome propensity on the ground, making it vulnerable to attack by predators.</p>
<p>Despite its reasonably copious strength of numbers, the providence petrel is deemed to be in a precarious disposition because its breeding is confined to two mountain tops and one tiny islet, and is therefore at great risk from a catastrophe.</p>
<p>This species is classified as vulnerable. Main causes of death are predation by the endangered <span>Lord Howe rail</span> and flooding of burrows. Other dangers include <span>rat</span> predation and drowning in longline fishing gear. The current population is estimated at 64,000.</p>
<p>The scientific name of this species was given in honour of the Swedish botanist <span>Daniel Solander</span>, Solander's petrel being an alternative common name.</p>
