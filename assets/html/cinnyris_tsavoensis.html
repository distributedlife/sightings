<p>The <b>Tsavo Sunbird</b> (<i>Cinnyris tsavoensis</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. It is sometimes lumped with the <span>Purple-banded Sunbird</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is found in the <span>Tsavo</span> region of southeastern Kenya and nearby northern Tanzania, but not on the coast. It lives in arid scrub with <i><span>Commiphora</span></i> and <i><span>Acacia</span></i> trees and shrubs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Tsavo Sunbird is 9.5 to 10&#xA0;cm (3.75 to 4&#xA0;inches) long. The bill is down-curved and rather short for a sunbird, especially compared to that of the otherwise similar <span>Marico Sunbird</span>.</p>
<p>The female is greyish-brown above and on the head with a white eyebrow stripe; the throat is either white or dusky with white edges (malar strips). The underparts are faintly yellow-tinged white with dusky stripes on the breast. The tail is bluish-black with grey edges and tip.</p>
<p>The juvenile male looks like the dark-throated form of the female. Later it develops a black throat and black wing coverts, both with green feathers intermixed, and often a wide black stripe down the belly.</p>
<p>The adult male is apparently the same at all seasons: gleaming bluish-green above and on the head, with a black belly and lower breast. The upper breast may have a maroon band, missing the center or complete and 3 to 5&#xA0;mm wide. (The male Purple-banded Sunbird has a wider maroon band and a distinct non-breeding plumage.)</p>
<p>The song is "a rapid sputtering <i>tsustiseesee, chuchiti-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi sitisee-see-see-see chitisee&#x2026;</i>" and variants, sometimes only the last few notes. Calls resemble the Purple-banded Sunbird's: "[l]oud annoyance chatter, <i>chi-chi-chi-chi&#x2026;</i>" and "a high <i>tsik-tsiki-tsik</i> or <i>brrrzi.</i>"</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<p>Some authorities consider it a <span>subspecies</span> of the Purple-banded Sunbird. Here it is considered a separate species following the <i><span>Handbook of the Birds of the World</span></i> and other authorities.</p>
