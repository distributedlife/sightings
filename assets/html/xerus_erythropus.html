<p>The <b>striped ground squirrel</b> (<i>Xerus erythropus</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>squirrel</span> native to Africa. It was first described by <span>Geoffroy</span> in 1803, but the original publication may be unavailable, so that the <span>binomial authority</span> is today more often cited as "<span>Desmarest</span>, 1817".</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Striped ground squirrels are moderately large ground squirrels, ranging from 22 to 29 centimetres (8.7 to 11.4&#xA0;in) in length, with a tail that, at 19 to 26 centimetres (7.5 to 10.2&#xA0;in), is nearly as long as the body. Adults weigh between 0.5 and 1 kilogram (1.1 and 2.2&#xA0;lb). They have a coat of short, bristly fur, and are pale sandy to dark brown across most of the body, with whitish, nearly hairless, underparts. A narrow stripe of pure white fur runs down the flanks from the shoulders to the hips. The tail has hairs much longer than those on the body, which fan out to the sides, and are multi-coloured along their length, presenting a grizzled appearance. The ears are small, and the muzzle long, with a projecting, almost pointed, nose. The limbs are pale, with large feet and long, straight, claws. They can be distinguished from the otherwise similar <span>Cape</span> and <span>mountain ground squirrels</span> by the fact that female striped ground squirrels possess three pairs of teats, rather than just two.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Striped ground squirrels are found across Africa south of the Sahara and north of the tropical rainforest. They are found from the Atlantic coast in the west to <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Kenya</span> in the east, being absent in the Horn of Africa. They inhabit open or disturbed forests and <span>savannah</span> country, often near cultivated land, and, at the extremes of their range, coastal <span>scrubland</span> and <span>semidesert</span> regions. Fossils attributed to the species have been identified from <span>Pliocene</span> Ethopia.</p>
<p>Six subspecies are currently recognised:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology_and_behaviour">Biology and behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Striped ground squirrels are <span>diurnal</span> <span>herbivores</span>, and spend almost their entire lives on the ground, although are capable of climbing into bushes to reach food. They eat a range of seeds, nuts, and roots, and can be an agricultural pest, eating crops such as <span>cassava</span>, <span>yams</span>, <span>cotton</span> bolls, <span>peanuts</span>, and <span>sweet potatoes</span>. They may occasionally supplement their diet with eggs, insects, and other small animals. Their predators include <span>servals</span>, <span>jackals</span>, birds of prey, and <span>common puff adders</span>.</p>
<p>They forage throughout home ranges of about 12 hectares (30 acres) in semi-arid terrain, but their ranges overlap and they make frequent forays into surrounding areas in search of food. They mark their territories using scent glands on their cheeks, which they rub onto stones and tree trunks, although they do not appear to defend them from intruders.</p>
<p>The squirrels spend the night in burrows, which they dig with their large claws. Their burrows are usually simple in structure, with a central nest less than a metre below the surface, a single entrance tunnel, and a few blind-ending tunnels that almost reach the surface. The latter are used as escape routes, allowing the squirrel to rapidly break through to the surface; the main entrance tunnel is often also blocked with a temporary pile of dirt at night. Burrows may also contain caches of food, although these are more commonly located some distance away and concealed beneath stones or dead leaves. They also bury their urine, but not their dung.</p>
<p>Striped ground squirrels live alone, or in pairs, and greet other members of their species by sniffing each other nose-to-nose. They move with a jumping gait, frequently pausing to sniff or look around, and making longer leaps when they need to move more quickly. They normally hold their tail horizontally when moving, or upright when still, and can fluff it up into a "bottle-brush" when alarmed. They can make a chattering sound, similar to that of other squirrels.</p>
<p>Courtship consists of chasing behaviour, and litters are of two to six young. They can live for up to six years in captivity.</p>
