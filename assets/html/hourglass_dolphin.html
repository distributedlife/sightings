<p>The <b>hourglass dolphin</b> (<i>Lagenorhynchus cruciger</i>) is a small <span>dolphin</span> in the <span>family</span> <span>Delphinidae</span> that inhabits <span>Antarctic</span> and <span>subantarctic</span> waters.</p>
<p>The dolphin has rarely been seen. It was identified as a new <span>species</span> by Qouy and Galmard in 1824 from a drawing made in the <span>South Pacific</span> in 1820. It is the only <span>cetacean</span> to have been widely accepted as a species solely on witness accounts. By 1960, despite decades of <span>whaling</span> in the <span>Southern Ocean</span>, only three specimens had been recovered. As of 2010 only 6 complete and 14 partial specimens had been examined. Further information was obtained from 4 strandings and boats which searched for the dolphins in areas rarely visited by ships.</p>
<p>Though it is traditionally placed in the genus <i><span>Lagenorhynchus</span></i>, recent <span>molecular</span> analyses indicate that the hourglass dolphin is actually more closely related to the dolphins of the genus <i><span>Cephalorhynchus</span></i>.</p>

Hourglass dolphins in the Drake Passage</div>
</div>

<p>The hourglass dolphin is colored black and white and sometimes variations of dark grey. For this reason was colloquially known by whalers as a "sea <span>cow</span>". Each flank has a white patch at the front, above the beak, eye and flipper, and a second patch at the rear. These two patches are connected by a thin white strip, creating, loosely speaking, an <span>hourglass shape</span> and hence the common name of the dolphin. The scientific name <i>cruciger</i> is <span>Latin</span> for "cross-carrier". This refers to the area of black coloration, which, viewed from above, vaguely resembles a <span>Maltese cross</span> or <span>cross patt&#xE9;e</span>.</p>
<p>In its usual range the dolphin is easily identifiable. Only the <span>southern right whale dolphin</span> is of comparable size and lives as far south. The right whale dolphin does not have a <span>dorsal fin</span>, so the two species are easily distinguished. The fin considerably varies across individuals. It is generally tall and curved, and the curve may be particularly pronounced in older animals.</p>
<p>A fully grown adult is about 1.8 meters (5.9&#xA0;ft) length and weighs 90&#x2013;120 kilograms (200&#x2013;260&#xA0;lb). Males are thought to be slightly smaller and lighter than females, although the small number of specimens does not permit a firm conclusion.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_and_distribution">Population and distribution</span></h2>
<p>The range is <span>circumpolar</span> from close to the Antarctic ice pack to about 45&#xB0;S. The most northerly confirmed sightings were 36&#xB0;S in the South <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> and 33&#xB0;S near <span>Valpara&#xED;so</span>, <span>Chile</span>, in the <span>Pacific</span>. Sightings have been made most commonly from the south of New Zealand, around the <span>South Shetland Islands</span> and off <span>Tierra del Fuego</span>, <span>Argentina</span>. The species is unlikely to be particularly densely populated close to these lands.</p>
<p>One survey estimated the population size at more than 140,000 individuals.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Hourglass dolphins tend to move in groups of about 5 to 10. One <span>International Whaling Commission</span> study recorded a group of 60. Claimed groups of up to 100 have been found.</p>
<p>They share feeding grounds with other cetaceans such as <span>sei</span>, <span>pilot</span>, <span>bottlenose</span> and <span>minke whales</span> and <span>southern right whale dolphins</span>. They are regularly seen with <span>fin whales</span>. Whalers who were hunting these much larger animals used hourglass dolphins as "look-outs" to aid them in their hunt. Hourglass dolphins are keen bow-wave riders.</p>
<p>Examinations of the stomach contents of the few specimens indicate they eat various (unrecorded) types of <span>squid</span> and small fish.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The hourglass dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (<span>Pacific Cetaceans MOU</span>). Although they have not been studied extensively they are of least concern to conservationists.</p>
