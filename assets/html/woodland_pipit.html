<p>The <b>Wood Pipit</b> or <b>Woodland Pipit</b> (<i>Anthus nyassae</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> belonging to the <span>pipit</span> genus <i>Anthus</i> in the family <span>Motacillidae</span>. It was formerly included in the <span>Long-billed Pipit</span> (<i>Anthus similis</i>) but is now frequently treated as a separate species. It is a bird of <span>miombo</span> woodland in south-central <span>Africa</span>, unlike the Long-billed Pipit which inhabits open grassland. It perches in trees when flushed but forages on the ground for <span>invertebrates</span>.</p>
<p>It is 16-18 centimetres long. The upperparts are warm brown with dark streaks while the underparts are pale with some streaking on the breast. The bird has a dark eyestripe, white <span>supercilium</span> and pale outer tail-feathers. <span>Juveniles</span> have dark spots above and have more streaking below than the adults. The bird's <span>song</span> is high-pitched and monotonous.</p>
<p>The Long-billed Pipit is very similar but has a slightly longer <span>bill</span> and tail, a smaller pale area in the outer tail-feathers and a slightly lower voice.</p>
<p>The range of the Woodland Pipit extends from south-east <span>Gabon</span> eastwards to southern and western <span>Tanzania</span> and southwards as far as north-east <span>Namibia</span>, northern <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and north-west <span>Mozambique</span>. At least three <span>subspecies</span> are recognized: <i>A. n. nyassae</i>, <i>A. n. frondicolus</i> and <i>A. n. schoutedeni</i>. Some authors recognize a fourth subspecies, <i>A. n. chersophilus</i>.</p>
