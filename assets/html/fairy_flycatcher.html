<p>The <b>fairy flycatcher</b> or <b>fairy warbler</b> (<i>Stenostira scita</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. Formerly placed in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> <span>family</span>, Muscicapidae, it is now separated with some other "odd flycatchers" as the new family <span>Stenostiridae</span> (Beresford <i>et al.</i> 2005, Fuchs <i>et al.</i> 2006). It is the only member of the genus <i><b>Stenostira</b></i>.</p>
<p>It is an endemic resident breeder in southern <span>Africa</span> in <span>Botswana</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Lesotho</span> and <span>Namibia</span>, and a vagrant to <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>.</p>
<p><i>Stenostira scita</i> is a common seasonal <span>migrant</span>, breeding in <span>karoo</span> scrub and <span>fynbos</span> in the southern highlands, and migrating north in to spend the southern winter in thorn scrub at lower altitudes.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The fairy flycatcher is 11&#x2013;12&#xA0;cm in length. The adult is pale grey above with a black mask through the eye and a white <span>supercilium</span>. The wings are black with a long white stripe, and the long black tail has white sides. The throat is white, the breast is pale grey, and the belly is white with a pinkish-grey wash to its centre. The sexes are alike, but the juvenile is browner than the adult. The eye is brown and the bill and legs are black.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The fairy flycatcher is monogamous unless its mate dies, when it will seek a new partner. It builds an open cup nest from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in the branches of a tree or shrub but well concealed. The female lays two or three green eggs.</p>
<p>This bird is usually seen alone, in pairs, or small flocks. It feeds on small <span>insects</span> and other <span>invertebrates</span>, foraging in the foliage like a <span>warbler</span>.</p>
