<p>The <b>red-bellied paradise flycatcher</b> (<i>Terpsiphone rufiventer</i>), also known as the <b>black-headed paradise flycatcher</b>, is a medium-sized <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>.</p>
<p>However, the red-bellied paradise flycatcher is a common resident breeder in tropical western <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span>. This species is usually found in thick forests and other well-wooded habitats. Two <span>eggs</span> are laid in a tiny cup nest in a tree.</p>
<p>The adult male of this species is about 17&#xA0;cm long, but the long tail streamers nearly double the birds length. It has a black head, and the rest of the <span>plumage</span> is chestnut, other than a prominent black wingbar. The female is duller and lacks the tail streamers. Young birds are plain brown.</p>
<p>The males show considerable variation in plumage in some areas. There is a morph of this species in which the male has the chestnut parts of the plumage replaced by white, and some races have black tail streamers.</p>
<p>The red-bellied paradise flycatcher is a noisy bird with a sharp <i>zweet</i>call. It has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a <span>shrike</span>. It is <span>insectivorous</span>, often hunting by flycatching.</p>
<p>The black-bellied <span>African paradise flycatcher</span>, <i>Terpsiphone viridis</i>, is closely related to this species, and hybrids occur with the underparts a mixture of black and red.</p>
