<p><b>Heuglin's gull</b> or <b>Siberian gull</b> (<i>Larus heuglini</i>) is a <span>seabird</span> in the genus <i><span>Larus</span></i>. It is closely related to the <span>lesser black-backed gull</span> (<i>Larus fuscus</i>) and is often classified as a <span>subspecies</span> of it. It has also been included within the <span>herring gull</span> (<i>Larus argentatus</i>).</p>
<p>Birds in the eastern part of Heuglin's gull's range are often paler grey above and are frequently considered to be a separate subspecies <i>Larus heuglini taimyrensis</i> (<b>Taimyr gull</b>). Another possibility is that they are a result of hybridization between Heuglin's gulls and <span>Vega gulls</span>.</p>
<p>Heuglin's gulls breed in the <span>tundra</span> of northern <span>Russia</span> from the <span>Kola Peninsula</span> east to the <span>Taymyr Peninsula</span>. They are regularly reported from <span>Finland</span> and may breed there. They migrate south to winter in <span>Southwest</span>, <span>South</span>, <span>East Asia</span>, and <span>East Africa</span>. Small numbers are seen in <span>Southeast Asia</span>, it has been recorded in <span>South Africa</span> and it may occur as a vagrant in <span>Western Europe</span>.</p>
<p>They are large gulls with a rounded head, strong bill and long legs and wings. Length is from 53 to 70&#xA0;cm (21 to 28&#xA0;in), wingspan is from 138 to 158&#xA0;cm (54 to 62&#xA0;in) and body mass is from 745 to 1,360&#xA0;g (1.642 to 2.998&#xA0;lb). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 40.5 to 46.9&#xA0;cm (15.9 to 18.5&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 4.5 to 6.5&#xA0;cm (1.8 to 2.6&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 5.9 to 7.8&#xA0;cm (2.3 to 3.1&#xA0;in). The back and wings are dark grey, variable in shade but often similar to the <i>graelsii</i> race of the slightly smaller <span>lesser black-backed gull</span>. In winter the head is only lightly streaked with brown but there is heavier streaking on the hindneck. The legs are usually yellow but can be pink.</p>
<p><span>Moulting</span> takes place later than in most of their relatives so birds still have unstreaked heads and worn <span>primaries</span> in September and October. The primary feathers may not be fully grown until February or March when the head is still streaked.</p>
<p>They feed mainly on <span>molluscs</span>, <span>worms</span>, and <span>crustaceans</span>.</p>
