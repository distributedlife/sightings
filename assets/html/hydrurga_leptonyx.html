<p>The <b>leopard <span>seal</span></b> (<i>Hydrurga leptonyx</i>), also referred to as the <b>sea <span>leopard</span></b>, is the second largest species of seal in the <span>Antarctic</span> (after the <span>southern elephant seal</span>). It is most common in the Southern Hemisphere along the coast of Antarctica and on most sub-Antarctic islands, but can also be found on the coasts of southern <span>Australia</span>, <span>Tasmania</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>New Zealand</span>, <span>Lord Howe Island</span>, <span>Tierra del Fuego</span>, the <span>Cook Islands</span>, and the Atlantic coast of <span>South America</span>. It can live 26 years, possibly more.</p>
<p>Leopard seals are <span>predators</span>, feeding mainly on other seals, <span>penguins</span>, <span>fish</span>, and <span>krill</span>. <span>Killer Whales</span> are the only known, albeit infrequent, natural predators of leopard seals.</p>
<p>Along with all of the other <span>earless seals</span>, it belongs to the <span>family</span> <span>Phocidae</span>, and is the only <span>species</span> in the <span>genus</span> <i><b>Hydrurga</b></i>. The name <i>hydrurga</i> means "water worker" and <i>leptonyx</i> is the Greek for "small clawed".</p>

<p>The leopard seal is large and muscular, with a dark grey back and light grey on its stomach. Its throat is whitish with the black spots that give the seal its common name. Females are slightly larger than the males. The overall length of this seal is 2.4&#x2013;3.5 m (8.4&#x2013;11.7&#xA0;ft) and weight is from 200 to 600 kilograms (440 to 1,320&#xA0;lb). They are about the same length as the northern <span>walrus</span>, but usually less than half the weight.</p>
<p>Its front <span>teeth</span> are sharp like those of other <span>carnivores</span>, but its <span>molars</span> lock together in a way that allows them to sieve <span>krill</span> from the water, in the manner of the <span>crabeater seal</span>.</p>

<p>The leopard seal lives in the cold waters surrounding Antarctica. During the summer months, it hunts among the <span>pack ice</span> surrounding the continent, spending almost all of its time in the water. In the winter, it ranges north to the <span>sub-Antarctic islands</span>. Occasionally, individuals may be spotted on the southern coasts of <span>Argentina</span>, <span>Chile</span>, <span>Australia</span>, and <span>New Zealand</span>, and as far north as the <span>Cook Islands</span>. Juveniles are more often found in the north.</p>
<p>The leopard seal is a <span>solitary</span> creature and comes together in small groups only when it is time to mate. During the mating season, males and females make acoustic calls to each other over distances, with at least the males having individual variability in their vocalising sequence patterns. After a 9-month gestation, the female digs a hole in the ice, and gives birth to a single pup during the Antarctic summer. She protects the pup until it is able to fend for itself.</p>
<p>Leopard seals are not very vocal, although they occasionally make some grunting and growling noises.</p>
<p>The leopard seal is bold, powerful and curious. In the water, there is a fine line between curiosity and predatory behaviour, and it may 'play' with <span>penguins</span> it does not intend to eat. There are also records of leopard seals attacking divers. <span>Paul Nicklen</span>, a <span>National Geographic magazine</span> photographer, captured pictures of a leopard seal bringing live, injured, and then dead penguins to him, possibly in an attempt to teach the photographer how to hunt.</p>

Leopard seal feeding on <span>emperor penguin</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The leopard seal is second only to the <span>killer whale</span> among Antarctica's top predators. Its <span>canine teeth</span> are 2.5&#xA0;cm (1&#xA0;in). It feeds on a wide variety of creatures. Smaller seals probably eat mostly krill, but also squid and <span>fish</span>. Larger leopard seals probably switch from krill to more substantial prey, including <span>king</span>, <span>adelie</span>, <span>rockhopper</span>, <span>gentoo</span>, <span>emperor</span>, and <span>chinstrap penguins</span>, and less frequently, other seals, such as <span>crabeater seal</span>.</p>
<p>Around the sub-Antarctic island of <span>South Georgia</span>, the <span>Antarctic fur seal</span> (<i>Arctocephalus gazella</i>) is the main prey. Other prey include penguins and fish. <span>Antarctic krill</span> (<i>Euphausia superba</i>), <span>southern elephant seal</span> (<i>Mirounga leonina</i>) pups and seabirds other than penguins have also been found in leopard seal scats in small quantities.</p>
<p>When hunting penguins, the leopard seal patrols the waters near the edges of the ice, almost completely submerged, waiting for the birds to enter the ocean. It kills the swimming bird by grabbing the feet, then shaking the penguin vigorously and beating its body against the surface of the water repeatedly until the penguin is dead. Previous reports stating the leopard seal skins its prey before feeding have been found to be incorrect. Lacking the teeth necessary to slice its prey into manageable pieces, it flails its prey from side to side to tear and rip it into smaller pieces.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Phylogeny">Phylogeny</span></h2>
<p>The leopard seal is classified under the family Phocidae. Its closest relatives are the <span>Ross seal</span>, crabeater seal and the <span>Weddell seal</span>, which together are known as the lobodontine seals. All these seals descend from the superfamily Pinnipeda, which evolved from bear-like ancestors. They have diverged from other taxa in the order Carnivora.</p>
<p>The leopard seal has many features analogous to other species. For example the forearm and hand bones are similar in structure to those found in many mammal, reptile, and bird species. However, in the leopard seal, the fingers are covered in a web of skin, which they use to propel themselves through the water.</p>
<p>The leopard seals share homologous features with its close relatives, the lobodontine seals. They all have dark fur on the tops of their bodies and lighter fur on their underbellies. Though the colors vary between these species, the colored fur serves the same function, which is camouflage against predators and as it stalks its prey.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Attacks_on_humans">Attacks on humans</span></h2>
<p>Leopard seals are potentially highly dangerous towards humans, but attacks are rarely reported. Examples of aggressive behaviour, stalking and attacks have been documented. Notable incidents include:</p>

<p>Leopard seals have shown a particular predilection for attacking the black, torpedo-shaped <span>pontoons</span> of <span>rigid inflatable boats</span>, necessitating researchers to equip their craft with special protective guards to prevent them from being punctured.</p>
