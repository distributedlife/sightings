<p>The <b>African black swift</b> or <b>African swift</b> (<i>Apus barbatus</i>) is a small <span>bird</span> in the <span>swift</span> family. It breeds in <span>Africa</span> discontinuously from <span>Liberia</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Zaire</span>, <span>Uganda</span> and <span>Kenya</span> south to <span>South Africa</span>, and on <span>Madagascar</span>. The breeding habitat is damp mountains, typically between 1,600 - 2,400 m, but less often at lower altitudes. This species feeds readily over lowland, and can form very large flocks, often with other gregarious swifts.</p>

<p>The nominate South African subspecies is <span>migratory</span>, wintering further north. Other subspecies are resident. Of the other seven accepted forms, the most widespread is the small dark <i>A. b. roehli</i> of east Africa. Two other dark races, <i>A. b. balstoni</i> and <i>A. b. mayottensis</i>, are restricted to Madagascar and the <span>Comoro Islands</span> respectively. It has been suggested that some <i>balstoni</i> migrate to the continental mainland when not breeding, but this has not been proved.</p>
<p>East African birds nest in hollow trees, whereas in South Africa this species uses cliffs, usually inland but also on the coast. The African black swift is a colonial breeder, sometimes forming mixed colonies with <span>alpine swifts</span>. The nest is a shallow grass cup glued to the substrate with saliva, and the typical clutch is one or two eggs.</p>
<p>The African black swift is 16&#x2013;18&#xA0;cm long and bulky like a <span>pallid swift</span>; it appears entirely blackish-brown except for a small white or pale grey patch on the chin which is not visible from a distance. It has a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a <span>boomerang</span>. This species is very similar to <span>common swift</span> but can be distinguished under optimum viewing conditions by the contrast between its black back and paler secondary wing feathers. The heavier build also gives it a distinctive flight action, which consisted of a steady level flight interspersed with short glides.</p>
<p>The call is a loud double rasped hissing scream <i>zzzzzzzZZZTT</i>, dissimilar to that of its confusion species.</p>
