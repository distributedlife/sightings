<p><b>Jackson's mongoose</b> (<i>Bdeogale jacksoni</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>mongoose</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Bdeogale</span></i>. Discovered in 1889 by <span>Frederick John Jackson</span>, <span>Oldfield Thomas</span> in 1894 described it as <i>Galeriscus jacksoni</i>. It is most closely related to the <span>black-footed mongoose</span> of the same subgenus <i><span>Galeriscus</span></i> and both are sometimes united in a single species.</p>
<p>With a head and body length of more than 50&#xA0;cm (20&#xA0;in) and a body weight of 2&#x2013;3&#xA0;kg (4.4&#x2013;6.6&#xA0;lb), it is a large mongoose. Its long and dense fur is grizzled black and white, the cheeks, the throat and the sides of the neck are very yellowish, the legs are dark brown or black, and the bushy tail is white.</p>
<p>Jackson's mongoose feeds on <span>rodents</span> and <span>insects</span>, especially on <span>army ants</span>, and is mainly nocturnal and <span>crepuscular</span> and possibly solitary. Its distributional range in <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Uganda</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> is limited to some arboreous mountain regions. It appears to be rare, and in 2008, the IUCN classified it as <span>Near Threatened</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Body_features">Body features</span></h2>
<p>Jackson's mongoose is a large mongoose with a bushy tail. Its head and body length is 50.8&#x2013;57.1&#xA0;cm (20.0&#x2013;22.5&#xA0;in), its tail length is 28.3 to 32.4&#xA0;centimeters, its hind foot length is 8.6 to 10.8&#xA0;cm, its ear length is 2.3 to 3.5&#xA0;cm and its <span>body weight</span> is 2-3 kg. Young but already breeding animals may be markedly smaller than <span>adults</span>. From the black-footed mongoose, it is distinguishable by its much longer fur, especially on the tail, and yellowish tints on the neck and the throat.</p>
<p>The long and dense dorsal <span>fur</span> is grizzled black and white. The dorsal hairs are 20&#xA0;mm (0.79&#xA0;in) long with black and white rings. The muzzle and the chin are brownish white and the cheeks, the throat and the sides of the neck are very yellowish. The legs are dark brown or black and the tail is white. The ventral side is light gray and the underfur is dense and woolly. The <span>pinnae</span> are round and broad and the <span>muzzle</span> is blunt. The <span>rhinarium</span> is large, and the hairless extension of the median groove divides the upper lip. The fore and hind feet have only four <span>digits</span>. A hallux and pollex are absent as is common with <i>Bdeogale</i>. The <span>soles</span> are naked, and the <span>claws</span> are thick and strong.</p>
<p>The <span>dentition</span> of Jackson's mongoose is typical for mongooses. Three <span>incisors</span>, one <span>canine</span>, four <span>premolars</span> and two <span>molars</span> are on either side of each jaw. The total number of teeth is 40 and the <span>dental formula</span> is <span class="nowrap"><span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:-0.5em; font-size:85%; text-align:center;"><span style="display:block; line-height:1em; padding:0 0.1em;" title="upper dentition: Incisors.Canines.Premolars.Molars">3.1.4.2</span><span style="display:block; line-height:1em; padding:0 0.1em; border-top:1px solid;" title="lower dentition: Incisors.Canines.Premolars.Molars">3.1.4.2</span></span>&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;2 = 40</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_habits">Habitat and habits</span></h2>
<p>The <span>habitats</span> of Jackson's mongoose are <span>montane forests</span>, <span>bamboo</span> zones, and lowland forests in mountain vicinity. Its <span>population density</span> is low. It probably <span>hunts</span> frequently in the thick <span>herbaceous</span> growth around <span>swamps</span>.</p>
<p>Jackson's mongoose is <span>carnivorous</span>, <span>insectivorous</span> and <span>myrmecophagous</span>. In the Aberdare Mountains, the volume of food items in 40&#xA0;<span>scats</span> was over 50% <span>rodents</span>, including <i><span>Otomys</span></i>, <i><span>Dasymys</span></i> and <i><span>Praomys</span></i> and 40% <span>insects</span>, mostly army ants of the genus <i><span>Anomma</span></i>, but also <span>weevils</span>, other <span>beetles</span> and <span>caterpillars</span>. <span>Millipedes</span>, <span>snails</span>, <span>lizards</span>, and the eggs of <span>snakes</span> were also consumed. About 80% of the <span>juveniles</span>' diet were rodents, including <i>Otomys</i>, <span>brush-furred mice</span>, true <span>mice</span> and <i>Praomys</i>. They also fed on beetles, lizards, <span>birds</span>, and a few ants. Coping with columns of <span>army ants</span> may depend on maturity and learning, which suggests a recent evolutionary <span>adaptation</span> to this diet.</p>
<p>Jackson's mongoose is mainly <span>nocturnal</span> and <span>crepuscular</span>. In the Udzungwa Mountains, 73% of 25&#xA0;photos taken by <span>camera traps</span> during the night were shot between 7&#xA0;p.m. and midnight. It is possibly solitary, but often is seen in pairs and occasionally in groups of four. Nothing is known about its <span>reproduction</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The <span>distributional range</span> of Jackson's mongoose is very limited. It is known from central and southern <span>Kenya</span>, southeastern <span>Uganda</span> and the <span>Udzungwa Mountains</span> 900&#xA0;km to the south in central <span>Tanzania</span>, where it was first recorded in 2001/02. In the <span>Aberdare Range</span>, the <span>Mount Kenya</span> massif, and the <span>Mount Elgon</span> massif, it occurs at elevations up to 3300&#xA0;m above sea level. In the Udzungwa Mountains, it seems highly localized and has only been recorded within <span>Matunda Forest</span> at a maximum of 2.65&#xA0;km apart. It possibly inhabits other massifs of the <span>Eastern Arc Mountains</span>, including the <span>Uluguru Mountains</span>, the <span>Nguru Mountains</span> and the <span>Usambara Mountains</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<p>Jackson's mongoose is usually considered a <span>species</span> of the genus <i><span>Bdeogale</span></i>. It is most closely related to the <span>black-footed mongoose</span> (<i>Bdeogale nigripes</i>), from which it is distinguished by skull and skin differences, as whose mountain <span>isolate</span>, it is often treated. Both are sometimes united in the species <i>Bdeogale nigripes</i> or in the subgenus <i><span>Galeriscus</span></i>, or they are separated from <i>Bdeogale</i> as distinct genus <i>Galeriscus</i>.</p>
<p>Jackson's mongoose is treated as a separate species by Allen (1939), Rosevear (1974), Corbet and Hill (1980), Honacki et al. (1982), Nowak and Paradiso (1983), Corbet and Hill (1986), Schliemann (1988), Corbet and Hill (1991), Nowak (1991), Wozencraft (1993), Kingdon (1997), Nowak (1999), Pavlinov (2003), Wozencraft (2005), Van Rompaey et al. (2008) and Gilchrist et al. (2009). Kingdon (1977) treats it as a subspecies of the black-footed mongoose and D&#xFC;cker (1972) also considers them <span>conspecific</span>.</p>
<p>No <span>subspecies</span> of Jackson's mongoose have been described.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nomenclature">Nomenclature</span></h2>
<p><span>Oldfield Thomas</span> in June 1894 described Jackson's mongoose as <span>type species</span> <i>Galeriscus jacksoni</i> of the new genus <i>Galeriscus</i>. He specified the type locality as <span>Mianzini</span> in the land of the <span>Maasai</span> at an elevation of 8000&#xA0;ft (2438&#xA0;m) above sea level. <span>Reginald Ernest Moreau</span>, <span>George Henry Evans Hopkins</span> and <span>Robert William Hayman</span> in 1945/46 restricted the type locality at Mianzini to a few miles east-southeast of <span>Lake Naivasha</span>, on the southern end of the <span>Kinangop Plateau</span> and to an elevation of 9000&#xA0;ft (2743&#xA0;m).</p>
<p><span>Frederick John Jackson</span> discovered Jackson's mongoose in 1889 and in 1894 sent a skin without skull to the <span>British Museum</span> in London. Led astray by the poor and incomplete <span>type specimen</span>, Thomas originally believed it to be related to the <span>grisons</span>. <span>Paul Matschie</span> in 1895 named it <i>Massaimarder</i> (German, "Maasai marten"), but was the first to recognize it as a <i>Bdeogale</i>. <span>Reginald Innes Pocock</span> in 1916, too, considered <i>Galeriscus</i> a synonym of <i>Bdeogale</i>. <span>Ned Hollister</span> in 1918 assumed it to be a geographic subspecies of the black-footed mongoose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_and_conservation">Population and conservation</span></h2>
<p>Jackson's mongoose occurs in isolated populations and appears to be rare. There are no reliable data on its population, though. The <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> in 2008 classified it as <span>Near Threatened</span>, almost qualifying as <span>Threatened</span>. This was justified with its assumed decline in <span>population size</span> of 20 to 25% within the last 15 years due to <span>habitat destruction</span>. Given its dependence on forest habitat, its main threat is likely to be ongoing forest loss. It was classified as Insufficiently Known in 1988, 1990 and 1994, and as <span>Vulnerable</span> in 1996.</p>
<p>Several populations of Jackson's mongoose are in <span>protected areas</span>, including <span>Aberdare National Park</span>, <span>Mount Kenya National Park</span>, probably <span>Mount Elgon National Park</span> and <span>Udzungwa Mountains National Park</span>. In Tanzania, all confirmed localities are within protected areas. It is also probably more widely distributed than currently known. De Luca and Rovero (2006) recommend the full protection of forests adjacent to the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and a survey of other East African groundwater-dependent forests for its presence.</p>
