<p>The <b>red knot</b> (<i>Calidris canutus</i>) (just <b>knot</b> in <span>Europe</span>) is a medium sized <span>shorebird</span> which breeds in <span>tundra</span> and the <span>Arctic Cordillera</span> in the far north of <span>Canada</span>, <span>Europe</span>, and <span>Russia</span>. It is a large member of the <i><span>Calidris</span></i> sandpipers, second only to the <span>Great Knot</span>. Six <span>subspecies</span> are recognised.</p>
<p>Their diet varies according to season; arthropods and larvae are the preferred food items at the breeding grounds, while various hard-shelled molluscs are consumed at other feeding sites at other times. North American breeders <span>migrate</span> to coastal areas in Europe and <span>South America</span>, while the <span>Eurasian</span> populations winter in <span>Africa</span>, <span>Papua New Guinea</span>, <span>Australia</span>, and <span>New Zealand</span>. This species forms enormous flocks when not breeding.</p>

<p>This Red Knot was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in the landmark 1758 <span>tenth edition</span> of his <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i> as <i>Tringa canutus</i>. One theory is that it gets its name and species epithet from King <span>Canute</span>, Knot being another form of Canute; the name would refer to the knot's foraging along the tide line and the <span>story of Canute and the tide</span>. Another etymology is that the name is <span>onomatopoeic</span>, based on the bird's grunting call note.</p>

<p>The Red Knot and the <span>Great Knot</span> were originally the only two species placed in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Calidris</span></i> but many other species of sandpiper were subsequently added. A 2004 study found that the genus was <span>polyphyletic</span>, and that the closest relative of the two knot species is the <span>Surfbird</span> (currently <i>Aphriza virgata</i>).</p>
<p>There are six <span>subspecies</span>, in order of size;</p>

<p>Studies based on mitochondrial sequence divergence and models of <span>paleoclimatic changes</span> during the glacial cycles suggest that <i>canutus</i> is the most basal population, separating about 20,000 years ago (95% confidence interval: 60,000&#x2013;4,000 years ago) with two distinct lineages of the American and Siberian breeders emerging about 12,000 years ago (with a 95% confidence interval: 45,000&#x2013;3,500 years ago).</p>

<p>In the breeding season the Red Knot has a <span>circumpolar</span> distribution in the high <span>Arctic</span>, then migrates to coasts around the world from 50&#xB0; N to 58&#xB0; S. The red knot has one of the longest migrations of any bird. Every year it travels more than 9,000 miles from the Arctic to the southern tip of South America. The exact migration routes and wintering grounds of individual subspecies are still somewhat uncertain. The nominate race <i>C. c. canutus</i> breeds in the <span>Taymyr Peninsula</span> and possibly <span>Yakutia</span> and migrates to the Western Europe and then down to western and southern <span>Africa</span>. <i>C. c. rogersi</i> breeds in the <span>Chukchi Peninsula</span> in eastern Siberia, and winters in eastern <span>Australia</span> and <span>New Zealand</span>. Small and declining numbers of <i>rogersi</i> (but possibly of the later described <i>piersmai</i>) winter in the <span>mudflats</span> in the <span>Gulf of Mannar</span> and on the eastern coast of India. The recently split race <i>C. c. piersmai</i> breeds in the <span>New Siberian Islands</span> and winters in north-western Australia. <i>C. c. roselaari</i> breeds in <span>Wrangel Island</span> in Siberia and north-western <span>Alaska</span>, and it apparently winters in <span>Florida</span>, <span>Panama</span> and <span>Venezuela</span>. <i>C. c. rufa</i> breeds in the Canadian low Arctic, and winters South America, and <i>C. c. islandica</i> breeds in the Canadian high Arctic as well as <span>Greenland</span>, and winters in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Birds wintering in west Africa were found to restrict their daily foraging to a range of just 2&#x2013;16&#xA0;km of intertidal area and roosted a single site for several months. In temperate regions such as the Wadden Sea they have been found to change roost sites each week and their feeding range may be as much as 800&#xA0;km during the course of a week.</p>
<p><span>B95</span>, also known as Moonbird, is a noted individual of the subspecies <i>C. c. rufa</i>. A male, he has become famous amongst conservationists for his extreme longevity &#x2014; he was aged at least 20 as of his last sighting in May 2014.</p>

Nonbreeding adult</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>An adult Red Knot is the second largest <i>Calidris</i> sandpiper, measuring 23&#x2013;26&#xA0;cm (9&#x2013;10&#xA0;in) long with a 47&#x2013;53&#xA0;cm (18.5&#x2013;21&#xA0;in) <span>wingspan</span>. The body shape is typical for the genus, with a small head and eyes, a short neck and a slightly tapering <span>bill</span> that is no longer than its head. It has short dark legs and a medium thin dark bill. The winter, or basic, <span>plumage</span> becomes uniformly pale grey, and is similar between the sexes. The alternate, or breeding, plumage is mottled grey on top with a cinnamon face, throat and breast and light-coloured rear belly. The alternate plumage of females is similar to that of the male except it is slightly lighter and the eye-line is less distinct. <i>canutus, islandica</i> and <i>piersmai</i> are the "darker" subspecies. Subspecies <i>rogersi</i> has a lighter belly than either <i>roselaari</i> or <i>piersmai</i>, and <i>rufa</i> is the lightest in overall plumage. The transition from alternate to basic plumages begins at the breeding site but is most pronounced during the southwards migration. The <span>molt</span> to alternate plumage begins just prior to the northwards migration to the breeding grounds, but is mostly during the migration period.</p>
<p>The large size, white wing bar and grey rump and tail make it easy to identify in flight. When feeding the short dark green legs give it a characteristic 'low-slung' appearance. When foraging singly, they rarely call, but when flying in a flock they make a low monosyllabic <i>knutt</i> and when migrating they utter a disyllabic <i>knuup-knuup</i>. They breed in the moist tundra during June to August. The display song of the male is a fluty <i>poor-me</i>. The display includes circling high with quivering wing beats and tumbling to the ground with the wings held upward. Both sexes <span>incubate</span> the eggs, but the female leaves parental care to the male once the eggs have hatched.</p>
<p>Juvenile birds have distinctive submarginal lines and brown coverts during the first year. In the breeding season the males can be separated with difficulty (&lt;80% accuracy in comparison to molecular methods) based on the more even shade of the red underparts that extend towards the rear of the belly.</p>
<p>The weight varies with subspecies, but ranges between 100 and 200&#xA0;g (45&#x2013;91&#xA0;oz). Red Knots can double their weight prior to migration. Like many migratory birds they also reduce the size of their digestive organs prior to migration. The extent of the atrophy is not as pronounced as species like the <span>Bar-tailed Godwit</span>, probably because there are more opportunities to feed during migration for the Red Knot. Red Knots are also able to change the size of their digestive organs seasonally. The size of the <span>gizzard</span> increases in thickness when feeding on harder foods on the wintering ground and decreases in size while feeding on softer foods in the breeding grounds. These changes can be very rapid, occurring in as little as six days.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet_and_feeding">Diet and feeding</span></h3>
<p>On the breeding grounds, Knots eat mostly <span>spiders</span>, <span>arthropods</span>, and larvae obtained by surface pecking, and on the wintering and migratory grounds they eat a variety of hard-shelled prey such as bivalves, <span>gastropods</span> and small <span>crabs</span> that are ingested whole and crushed by a muscular stomach.</p>
<p>While feeding in mudflats during the winter and migration Red Knots are tactile feeders, probing for unseen prey in the mud. Their feeding techniques include the use of shallow probes into the mud while pacing along the shore. When the tide is ebbing, they tend to peck at the surface and in soft mud they may probe and plough forward with the bill inserted to about a centimetre depth. The bivalved mollusc <i><span>Macoma</span></i> is their preferred prey on European coasts, swallowing them whole and breaking them up in their gizzard. In <span>Delaware Bay</span>, they feed in large numbers on the eggs of horseshoe crabs which spawn just as the birds arrive in mid-summer. They are able to detect molluscs buried under wet sand from changes in the pressure of water that they sense using <span>Herbst corpuscles</span> in their bill. Unlike many tactile feeders their <span>visual field</span> is not panoramic (allowing for an almost 360 degree field of view), as during the short breeding season they switch to being visual hunters of mobile, unconcealed prey, which are obtained by pecking. Pecking is also used to obtain some surface foods in the wintering and migratory feeding grounds, such as the eggs of <span>horseshoe crabs</span>.</p>

Red Knot in breeding plumage</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Red Knot is <span>territorial</span> and seasonally <span>monogamous</span>; it is unknown if pairs remain together from season to season. Males and females breeding in Russia have been shown to exhibit <span>site fidelity</span> towards their breeding locales from year to year, but there is no evidence as to whether they exhibit territorial fidelity. Males arrive before females after migration and begin defending territories. As soon as males arrive, they begin displaying, and aggressively defending their territory from other males.</p>
<p>The Red Knot nests on the ground, near water, and usually inland. The <span>nest</span> is a shallow scrape lined with leaves, lichens and <span>moss</span>. Males construct three to five nest scrapes in their territories prior to the arrival of the females. The female lays three or more usually four eggs, apparently laid over the course of six days. The eggs measure 43 x 30&#xA0;mm (1.7 x 1.2&#xA0;in) in size and are ground coloured, light olive to deep olive buff, with a slight gloss. Both parents <span>incubate</span> the eggs, sharing the duties equally. The off duty parent forages in flocks with others of the same species. The incubation period lasting around 22 days. At early stages of incubation the adults are easily flushed from the nest by the presence of humans near the nest, and may not return for several hours after being flushed. However in later stages of incubation they will stay fast on the eggs. Hatching of the clutch is usually synchronised. The chicks are <span>precocial</span> at hatching, covered in downy cryptic feathers. The chicks and the parents move away from the nest within a day of hatching and begin foraging with their parents. The female leaves before the young fledge while the males stay on. After the young have fledged, the male begins his migration south and the young make their first migration on their own.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The Red Knot has an extensive range, estimated at 0.1&#x2013;1.0&#xA0;million&#xA0;square kilometres (0.04&#x2013;0.38&#xA0;million square miles), and a large population of about 1.1 million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span>. However many local declines have been noted such as the dredging of intertidal flats for edible cockles (<i><span>Cerastoderma edule</span></i>) which led to reductions in the wintering of <i>islandica</i> in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The quality of food at migratory stopover sites is a critical factor in their migration strategy.</p>
<p>This is one of the species to which the <i><span>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</span></i> (AEWA) applies. This commits signatories to regulate the taking of listed species or their eggs, to establish protected areas to conserve habitats for the listed species, to regulate hunting and to monitor the populations of the birds concerned.</p>

Red Knot feeding on horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, large numbers of Red Knot were shot for food as they migrated through <span>North America</span>. It is hypothesized that more recently, the birds have become threatened as a result of commercial harvesting of <span>horseshoe crabs</span> in the <span>Delaware Bay</span> which began in the early 1990s. Delaware Bay is a critical stopover point during spring migration; the birds refuel by eating the eggs laid by these crabs (with little else to eat in the Delaware Bay). If horseshoe crab abundance in the Bay is reduced there may fewer eggs to feed on which could negatively affect knot survival.</p>
<p>In 2003, scientists projected that at its current rate of decline the American subspecies might become extinct as early as 2010, but as of April 2011 the subspecies is still <span>extant</span>. Several environmental groups have petitioned the U.S. government to list the birds as endangered, but thus far their requests have not been granted. In New Jersey, state and local agencies are taking steps to protect these birds by limiting horseshoe crab harvesting and restricting beach access. In Delaware, a two-year ban on the harvesting of horseshoe crabs was enacted but struck down by a judge who cited insufficient evidence to justify the potential disruption to the fishing industry but a male-only harvest has been in place in recent years.</p>
