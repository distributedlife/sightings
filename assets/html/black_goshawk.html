<p>The <b>black sparrowhawk</b> (<i>Accipiter melanoleucus</i>), sometimes known as the <b>black goshawk</b> or <b>great sparrowhawk</b>, is the largest African member of the genus <i><span>Accipiter</span></i>. It occurs mainly in forests and non-desert areas south of the <span>Sahara</span>, particularly where there are large trees suitable for nesting; favoured habitat includes suburban and human-altered landscapes. It preys primarily on birds of moderate size, such as pigeons and doves in suburban areas.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Typically, both genders of the black sparrowhawk are pied black-and-white when mature; generally the <span>plumage</span> is predominantly black, but with a white chest and throat. Some individuals may have a tendency towards <span>melanism</span>, showing white only on the throat and spots on the belly. As a rule there is no noticeable difference between the plumage of mature females and males. The tails are cross-barred with about three or four paler stripes, and the undersides of the wings with perhaps four or five, but these are less well-defined.</p>
<p>Young chicks have black eyes and white down, but when the feathers erupt they are predominantly brown. The full plumage of juveniles is a range of browns and <span>russets</span> with dark streaks along the head and, more conspicuously, down the chest. Commonly there are white or light-coloured spots and streaks as well, mainly on the wings. The brown plumage being a sign of immaturity, it does not attract as dangerously aggressively territorial behaviour as the mature black-and-white would. As the young birds mature, their eyes change in colour from deep black, though brown, to red.</p>

<p>The black sparrowhawk is one of the world's largest <i>Accipiters</i>, only the <span>Henst's</span>, <span>Meyer's</span> and the <span>northern goshawk</span> can match or exceed its size. As is common in the genus <i><span>Accipiter</span></i>, male black sparrowhawks are smaller than females. Typically the weights of males lie between 450 and 650&#xA0;g (0.99 and 1.43&#xA0;lb) as compared to females, which have weights in the range 750 to 980&#xA0;g (1.65 to 2.16&#xA0;lb). The typical total length is 40&#x2013;54&#xA0;cm (16&#x2013;21&#xA0;in). The legs are yellow. As in most <i>Accipiters</i>, the wings are relatively modest in size for such a large raptor, the <span>wing chord</span> measuring 25.1&#x2013;34.4&#xA0;cm (9.9&#x2013;13.5&#xA0;in) and the wingspan measuring 77&#x2013;105&#xA0;cm (30&#x2013;41&#xA0;in). The <span>tarsi</span> and <span>tail</span> are both relatively long, also typical <i>Accipiter</i> features, at 7.2&#x2013;9&#xA0;cm (2.8&#x2013;3.5&#xA0;in) and 19&#x2013;27&#xA0;cm (7.5&#x2013;10.6&#xA0;in), respectively. The features of the black sparrowhawk (and <i>Accipiters</i> in general) are reflective of the necessities that come with actively hunting in dense arboreal habitats, though this species can also hunt very efficiently in open areas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>There are 2 subspecies of the black sparrowhawks: <i>Accipiter melanoleucus melanoleucus</i>, which was named by A. Smith in 1830, and <i>Accipiter melanoleucus temminckii</i>, which was named by Hartlaub in 1855. As described in the next section, the 2 subspecies occur in different regions of Africa and both belong to the genus <i>Accipiter</i> in the <span>Accipitridae</span> family along with other well&#xAD;&#x2010;known members such as hawks and eagles, all of which are part of the <span>Falconiformes</span> order.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_Distribution">Habitat and Distribution</span></h2>
<p>Black sparrowhawks are relatively widespread and common in sub-Saharan Africa and listed as not globally threatened by CITES. Densities range from one pair per 13 square kilometers in <span>Kenya</span> to one pair per 38-150 square kilometers in <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Both subspecies are only found in parts of Africa that are south of the Sahara desert; <i>A. m. temminckii</i> inhabit much of the northwest section such as <span>Senegal</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, and <span>Central African Republic</span>, while <i>A. m. melanoleucus</i> can be found starting from the northeast section down to <span>South Africa</span>. They naturally inhabit patches of forests, rich woodlands and riverine strips extending into dry bush areas. They can be found in many areas as long as they have large trees, including <span>mangroves</span> in coastal <span>Kenya</span>. especially in southern Africa, black sparrowhawks have adapted to stands of the non-&#xAD;indigenous <span>eucalypt</span>, <span>poplar</span>, and <span>pine</span>, all of which are grown commercially and are able to grow up to 15&#xA0;m (49&#xA0;ft) taller than native trees. Their adaptability to secondary forests and cultivations (they are not uncommon around homesteads now) is one of the reasons why they are not as greatly impacted by deforestation as many African forest birds and may actually increase populations where such stands have been placed in otherwise open country. They can be in elevation from sea-level to 3,700&#xA0;m (12,100&#xA0;ft).</p>
<p>In some areas such as <span>Cape Peninsula</span>, the sparrowhawks face habitat competition with <span>Egyptian geese</span> (<i>Alopochen aegyptiaca</i>), an aggressive species known to steal the nests of the sparrowhawks. This results in a costly loss for the sparrowhawks after the time and energy spent building the nest and may also lead to the death of current offspring. However, sparrowhawks are known to have more than 1 nest at a time, so in the event that one is usurped by an <span>Egyptian goose</span>, the pair would either inhabit the alternative nest and/or build a new one.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocalizations">Vocalizations</span></h3>
<p>Normally silent except during the breeding season. Males are known to make loud "keeyp" sounds while females make short "kek" sounds.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>Black sparrowhawks prey primarily on mid-sized birds. Most prey is spotted from a foliage-concealed perch and then is killed in flight while on a short flying dash. Less often, they stoop or chase prey seen during low or high flight over open country or near the canopy of trees and, in some cases, may even pursue prey on foot. Although kills are often made in under a minute after the initial attack, occasionally this species may engage in a prolonged pursuit over several minutes. They have been known to scan for antswarms so they can predate birds attracted to them. Most birds preyed on by this species are in the size range of 80&#x2013;300&#xA0;g (2.8&#x2013;10.6&#xA0;oz). However, they have taken <span>guineafowl</span> weighing up to 1.5&#xA0;kg (3.3&#xA0;lb). <span>Doves</span> are the primary prey of males, wheres females take a greater quantity of larger prey such as <span>pigeons</span> and <span>francolins</span>. With some regularity, they prey on other raptor species, including <span>shikra</span>, <span>Ovambo sparrowhawk</span>, <span>African goshawk</span> and <span>wood owl</span>. They often take species such as <span>rock pigeons</span> that have flourished due to urban growth and settlement. It is one of the few fortunate species that have been able to adapt to their changing habitat due to <span>afforestation</span> by taking advantage of the increase in dove and pigeon populations. They may also feed on poultry found in nearby villages, which have been inadvertently made available to them by humans. On occasion, they may supplement their diet with small <span>mammals</span>, such as <span>rodents</span> and juvenile <span>mongooses</span>. Black sparrowhawks can carry prey up to 12&#xA0;km (7.5&#xA0;mi), usually well above the canopy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p><i>A. m. temminckii</i> usually breed between August and November while <i>A. m. melanoleucus</i> breed between May and October. In <span>Zambia</span>, they breed at an intermediate time, between July and February. Black sparrowhawks in eastern Africa seemingly breed at almost any time of the year. These birds are particular about their nest sites; they prefer sites within the <span>tree canopy</span> to protect their offspring from adverse weather conditions and other predators. Nests have been found from 7 to 36&#xA0;m (23 to 118&#xA0;ft) high in trees, though (in rare cases) have been found on the ground between large tree trunks. However, the nests are usually not deep within the forest in order to stay within close proximity of the hunting habitat outside of the forest.</p>
<p>The nests are made up of thousands of sticks collected by both parents and are usually lined with green eucalypt leaves, possibly to prevent pieces of meat from falling between the gaps and to deter carriers of diseases, such as <span>mites</span> and <span>insects</span>, due to the repelling smell of the leaves. The nests can measure from 50 to 70&#xA0;cm (20 to 28&#xA0;in) in width and 30&#x2013;75&#xA0;cm (12&#x2013;30&#xA0;in) deep.</p>
<p>Black sparrowhawks form <span>monogamous</span> pairs and are known to attempt multiple brooding; at any one time, a mated pair has more than one nest with offspring of different ages. This behavior is exceeding rare in birds of prey. Typically, a pair will lay 2-&#xAD;4 eggs (rarely 1 to 4) and <span>incubate</span> them for about 34-&#xAD;38 days until they hatch. The newly hatched chicks are semi&#xAD;<span>altricial</span> in that they are fully covered in white down feathers but cannot leave the nest since they rely on the parents for food, warmth, and protection. After 37 to 50 days, the juveniles are <span>fledged</span> but the parents will continue to care for them for the next 37 to 47 days. The female usually lays a new clutch of eggs in her second nest about 60 to 90 days after her first clutch has fledged; both parents will then care for both nests. Nests are often reused after the juveniles have left.</p>
