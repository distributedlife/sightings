<p>The <b>African paradise flycatcher</b> (<i>Terpsiphone viridis</i>) is a medium-sized <span>passerine</span> bird.</p>
<p>The African paradise flycatcher is a common resident breeder in <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span>. This species is usually found in open forests and savannah habitats. Two or three eggs are laid in a tiny cup nest in a tree.</p>
<p>The adult male African paradise flycatcher is about 17&#xA0;cm long, but the very long tail streamers double this. It has a black head, neck and underparts, and chestnut wings and tail. There is a prominent white wingbar. The female has a browner tint to the underparts and lacks the wingbar and tail streamers. Young birds are similar to the female but duller.</p>
<p>The males show considerable variation in plumage in some areas. There is a morph of this species in which the male has the chestnut parts of the plumage replaced by white, and some races have black tail streamers.</p>
<p>The African paradise flycatcher is a noisy bird with a harsh scolding call. It has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a <span>shrike</span>. It is insectivorous, often hunting by flycatching.</p>
<p>The <span>red-bellied paradise flycatcher</span>, <i>Terpsiphone rufiventer</i>, is closely related to this species, and hybrids occur with the underparts a mixture of black and red.</p>
