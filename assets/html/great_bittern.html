<p>The <b>Eurasian bittern</b> or <b>great bittern</b> (<i>Botaurus stellaris</i>) is a wading <span>bird</span> of the <span>heron</span> family <span>Ardeidae</span>. It is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>This species was first described as <i>Ardea stellaris</i> by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i><span>Systema naturae</span></i> in 1758. The genus name <i>Botaurus</i> was given by English naturalist <span>James Francis Stephens</span> and is the <span>Latin</span> for bittern, and also bull, because the bittern's call resembles the bellowing of a bull. The specific epithet, <i>stellata</i>, is the Latin for <i>starry</i>, in reference to its speckled <span>plumage</span>. Its folk names include "barrel-maker", "bog-bull", "bog hen", "bog-trotter" and "mire drum", mainly with reference to its voice or habitat. The <span>Norfolk</span> name "butterbump" refers to its high fat content when eaten as food.</p>

<p>Bitterns are thickset herons with bright, pale, buffy-brown plumage covered with dark streaks and bars, similar in appearance to the <span>American bittern</span>, <i>Botaurus lentiginosa</i>. As its alternate name suggests, this species is the largest of the bitterns. The Eurasian or great bittern is 69&#x2013;81&#xA0;cm (27&#x2013;32&#xA0;in) in length, with a 100&#x2013;130&#xA0;cm (39&#x2013;51&#xA0;in) wingspan and a body mass of 0.87&#x2013;1.94&#xA0;kg (1.9&#x2013;4.3&#xA0;lb).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Distribution in Europe as a whole is estimated at 20-44,000 males. It usually inhabits <i><span>Phragmites</span></i> <span>reed beds</span>. The population is declining in much of its temperate <span>European</span> and <span>Asian</span> range. It is resident in the milder west and south, but <span>migrates</span> south from areas where the water freezes in winter. In the UK, the main areas are <span>Lancashire</span> and <span>East Anglia</span> with an estimated 44 breeding pairs. In Ireland it died out as a breeding species in the mid-19th century, but in 2011 a single bird was spotted in <span>County Wexford</span> and there have been a number of subsequent sightings.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Races">Races</span></h3>
<p>Besides the Eurasian race, <i>Botaurus s. stellaris</i>, another race, <i>Botaurus s. capensis</i> exists in southern Africa, which occurs sparingly in marshes of the east coast, the <span>Okavango Delta</span> and the upland foothills of the <span>Drakensberg</span>. The southern race suffered catastrophic decline during the 20th century due to wetland degradation, and unlike the northern race it is of highest conservation concern.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Usually solitary, the great bittern forages in <span>reed beds</span>, walking stealthily or remaining still above a body of water where prey may occur. If it senses that it has been seen, it points its bill directly upwards and becomes motionless so that its cryptic plumage causes it to blend into the surrounding reeds: an action known as <i>bitterning</i>. It is most active at dawn and dusk.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Males are polygamous with each mating with up to five females. The nest is built in the previous year's standing reeds and consists of a platform some 30&#xA0;cm across. Four or five eggs are laid in late March and April and incubated by the female bird. After hatching, the chicks spend about two weeks in the nest and then disperse amongst the reeds.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Bitterns feed on fish, eels, amphibians and invertebrates, hunting along the reed margins in shallow water.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h3>
<p>The mating call or contact call of the male is a deep, sighing fog-horn or bull-like <i>boom</i> with a quick rise and an only slightly longer fall, easily audible from a distance of three miles on a calm night. "Butter bump" and "bitter bum" were onomatopoeic colloquial names for the bird in some localities. Others, each unique to a particular part of Great Britain, include "bog blutter", "bog-bull", "bog bumper", "bog drum", "boom bird", "bottle-bump", "bull of the bog", "bull of the mire", "bumpy cors", "butter bump" and "heather blutter". The number of names is one indication of how widespread they used to be. The call is mainly given between January and April during the mating season. Surveys of Eurasian bitterns are carried out by noting the number of distinct male booms in a given area. Prior to modern science, it was unknown how such a small bird produced a call so low-pitched: common explanations included that the bird made its call into a straw or that it blew directly into the water. It is now known that the sound is produced by expelling air from the <span>oesophagus</span> with the aid of powerful muscles surrounding it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_literature">In literature</span></h2>
<p>Eurasian bittern is proposed as a rational explanation behind the mythical creature <span>drekavac</span> in short story "Brave Mita and Drekavac from the Pond" by <span>Branko &#x106;opi&#x107;</span>.</p>
<p>The 18th-century Scottish poet <span>James Thomson</span> refers to the bittern's "boom" in his poem "Spring" (written 1728), published as part of his <i><span>The Seasons</span></i> (published 1735): "The Bittern knows the time, with bill ingulpht / To shake the sounding marsh&#xA0;..."</p>
<p>The species is mentioned in <span>George Crabbe</span>'s 1810 narrative poem <i><span>The Borough</span></i>, to emphasise the ostracised, solitary life of the poem's villain, <span>Peter Grimes</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<p>And the loud Bittern from the bull-rush home<br/>
Gave from the Salt-ditch side the bellowing boom:</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Thomas MacDonagh</span>, the Irish poet executed for his part in the <span>Easter Rising</span>, translated a famous Gaelic poem by <span>Cathal Bu&#xED; Mac Giolla Ghunna</span> "The Yellow Bittern" ("An Bonn&#xE1;n Bu&#xED;" in the Irish). His friend and fellow poet <span>Francis Ledwidge</span> wrote a celebrated "Lament for Thomas MacDonagh" with the opening line "He shall not hear the bittern cry".</p>
<p>In the <span>Sherlock Holmes</span> novel <i><span>The Hound of the Baskervilles</span></i> by Sir <span>Arthur Conan Doyle</span>, the villain Stapleton proposes the boom of a bittern as an explanation for the howl attributed to the mystical hound.</p>
<p>Because of its secretive and skulking nature, it was then unclear exactly how the bittern produced its distinctive booming call. One early theory held that the bittern thrust its beak into the boggy ground of the marsh in which it lived, making its vocalization which was amplified and deepened as it reverberated through the water. A reference to this theory appears in <span>Chaucer</span>'s <span>The Wife of Bath's Tale</span>, lines 972-73: "And, as a bitore bombleth in the myre, She leyde hir mouth un-to the water doun&#xA0;..." </p>
<p><span>Sir Thomas Browne</span> disputed this claim in his <i><span>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</span></i>, Book III, Ch.27: "That a Bittor maketh that mugient noise, or as we term it Bumping, by putting its bill into a reed as most believe, or as <i>Bellonius</i> and <i>Aldrovandus</i> conceive, by putting the same in water or mud, and after a while retaining the air by suddenly excluding it again, is not so easily made out. For my own part, though after diligent enquiry, I could never behold them in this motion&#xA0;..." </p>
<p>Browne is said to have kept a bittern in his study, in an attempt to discover how the "boom" was produced.</p>
