<p>The <b>Friedmann's Lark</b> (<i>Mirafra pulpa</i>) is a species of <span>lark</span> in the <span>Alaudidae</span> family.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Friedmann's Lark is found in <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, and <span>Tanzania</span>, but its <span>population</span> and real <span>range</span> is very poorly known. The <span>type specimen</span> was collected in <span>Ethiopia</span> (from the <span>Konso</span>-<span>Sagan</span> area) in 1992, having only been seen one time since, in 1998; but most of what is known comes primarily from data collected in <span>Tsavo East</span> and <span>West National Parks</span>, in the <span>state</span> of <span>Kenya</span>. There are also a few records from <span>Tanzania</span>, from <span>Mkomazi Game Reserve</span>, south of <span>Arusha</span>.</p>
<p>In general, the natural <span>habitats</span> of <i>M. pulpa</i> are subtropical or tropical dry lowland <span>grasslands</span>. Being aloof and shy, it apparently chooses the moister (or less dry), ranker-growing of these areas, and where it can find it, those with more <span>bush-cover</span>. This is in contrast to the more dry, and more open environs preferred by many other species of <span>lark</span>.</p>
<p>It is nearly always witnessed only during certain times of year (in Tanzania, its during rainy season, for example), to the exclusion of other times; and often amongst other migrant species. These observations would seem to suggest that it is a <span>migratory bird</span>, but more corroborating data is needed to make a definitive determination.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Friedmann's Lark appears to subsist mainly on small <span>beetles</span>, <span>grasshoppers</span> and the like, as well as <span>grass</span> <span>seeds</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h3>
<p>It is best identified by its distinctive song; a long, drawn-out singular note, '<i>hoo-ee-oo</i>' (with slight stress on the <i>ee</i>), repeated at 1 or 2 second intervals. It is heard more often at night, and given while atop a bush or during undulating display flights.</p>
