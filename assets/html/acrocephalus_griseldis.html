<p>The <b>Basra Reed Warbler</b> (<i>Acrocephalus griseldis</i>) is a "<span>warbler</span>" of the genus <i><span>Acrocephalus</span></i>. It is an endemic breeder in East and southern <span>Iraq</span> and <span>Israel</span> in extensive beds of <span>papyrus</span> and <span>reeds</span>. It is easily mistaken for the <span>Great Reed Warbler</span> but is a bit smaller, has whiter under parts and has a narrower, longer and more pointed bill. It winters in <span>East Africa</span>. It is a very rare vagrant in <span>Europe</span>. The call is a gruff 'chaar', deeper than a <span>Reed Warbler</span>'s.</p>
<p>It is found in aquatic vegetation in or around shallow, fresh or brackish water, still or flowing, mainly in dense reedbeds. It is found in thickets and bushland when migrating or wintering.</p>
<p>In 2007, the species was discovered as a breeding bird in northern Israel </p>
