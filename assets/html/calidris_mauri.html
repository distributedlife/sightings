<p>The <b>western sandpiper</b>, <i>Calidris</i> or <i>Erolia mauri</i>, is a small <span>shorebird</span>.</p>
<p>Adults have dark legs and a short, thin, dark bill, thinner at the tip. The body is brown on top and white underneath. They are reddish-brown on the crown. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds, especially the <span>semipalmated sandpiper</span>. This is particularly the case in winter <span>plumage</span>, when both species are plain gray. The western sandpiper acquires winter plumage much earlier in the autumn than the semipalmated sandpiper.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is on <span>tundra</span> in eastern <span>Siberia</span> and <span>Alaska</span>. They nest on the ground usually under some vegetation. The male makes several scrapes; the female selects one and lays 4 eggs. Both parents <span>incubate</span> and care for dependent young, who feed themselves. Sometimes the female deserts her mate and brood prior to offspring fledging.</p>
<p>They <span>migrate</span> to both coasts of <span>North America</span> and <span>South America</span>. It is a very rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>These birds forage on mudflats during migration and the non-breeding season by probing or picking up food by sight. Foraging occurs on tundra and wet meadows during the breeding season. They mainly eat insects, small crustaceans, and mollusks.</p>
<p>This is one of the most abundant shorebird species in North America with a population in the millions.</p>
