<p>The <b>yellow-billed oxpecker</b> (<i>Buphagus africanus</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>starling</span> and <span>myna</span> family <span>Sturnidae</span>; some ornithologists regard the oxpeckers to be a separate family, the Buphagidae (Zuccon, 2006). It is native to the <span>savannah</span> of sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span> from <span>Senegal</span> east to <span>Sudan</span>. It is least common in the extreme east of its <span>range</span> where it overlaps with the <span>red-billed oxpecker</span>, despite always dominating that species when feeding.</p>
<p>The yellow-billed oxpecker nests in <span>tree</span> holes lined with hair plucked from <span>livestock</span>. It lays 2&#x2013;3 <span>eggs</span>. Outside the breeding season it is fairly gregarious, forming large, chattering <span>flocks</span>. Non-breeding birds will roost on their host animals at night.</p>
<p>The yellow-billed oxpecker eats <span>insects</span> and <span>ticks</span>. Both the <span>English</span> and scientific names arise from this species' habit of perching on large wild and domesticated <span>mammals</span> such as <span>cattle</span> and eating arthropod parasites. It will also perch on antelopes such as <span>wildebeest</span>. In a day an adult will take more than 100 engorged female <i>Boophilus decoloratus</i> ticks or 13,000 larvae.</p>
<p>However, their preferred food is <span>blood</span>, and while they may take ticks bloated with blood, they also feed on it directly (Feare 2003), pecking at the mammal's wounds. So the good the bird does to the mammal may be negated by its keeping the wounds open to <span>parasites</span> and disease. Whatever the net result, mammals generally tolerate oxpeckers (Feare 2003).</p>
<p>The yellow-billed oxpecker is 20&#xA0;cm long and has plain brown upperparts and head, buff underparts and a pale rump. The feet are strong. The adults' <span>bills</span> are yellow at the base and red at the tip, while juveniles have brown bills. Its flight is strong and direct. The call is a hissy, crackling <i>krisss, krisss</i>.</p>
