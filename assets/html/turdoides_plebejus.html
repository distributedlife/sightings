<p>The <b>Brown Babbler</b> (<i>Turdoides plebejus</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Leiothrichidae</span>. It is predominantly found in <span>West Africa</span>, but ranging from <span>the Gambia</span> to <span>Kenya</span>. The species is common across its range. The species is also known as the <b>Sudan Babbler</b>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>The Brown Babbler was described in 1828 by <span>Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar</span> from a specimen collected in the <span>Kordofan Province</span> of <span>Sudan</span>. He originally placed it in the <span>bulbul</span> genus <i><span>Ixos</span></i>. The species is colsely related to and forms a superspecies with the <span>White-headed Babbler</span> of eastern Sudan, <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Eritrea</span>, and the <span>Arrow-marked Babbler</span> of central and southern Africa. The Old World babbler family <span>Timaliidae</span> has been the subject of much research and has been split by some taxonomic authorities. This move that would place this species with the <span>laughingthrushes</span> in the family Leiothrichidae.</p>
<p>There are three recognised subspecies, the nominate race, <i>platycirca</i> and <i>cincera</i>. A fourth subspecies, <i>uamensis</i>, is synonymized with <i>cincera</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Brown Babbler is a medium sized <i>Turdoides</i> babbler, measuring 22&#x2013;25 centimetres (8.7&#x2013;9.8&#xA0;in) in length and weighs around 52&#x2013;80 grams (1.8&#x2013;2.8&#xA0;oz). The <span>plumage</span> is grey-brown with a white-streaked throat and breast and a scaled head. The wings are bronze-brown, the bill black and the legs dusky or slaty black. The iris of the eyes are yellow. The sexes are alike, and juvenile birds are like the adults but with plainer and browner plumage and brown irises.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Brown Babbler inhabits the broad band of the <span>Sahel</span> between the <span>Sahara Desert</span> and the tropical forests of Western Africa, from southern <span>Mauritania</span>, <span>Senegal</span> and the Gambia to southern Sudan, <span>Uganda</span> and western Kenya. The species lives in open <span>savanna</span>, wooded grasslands, <span>riparian</span> habitat in drier areas, degraded cultivation, farmlands, parks and gardens. The species is common across its range and readily lives in human modified habitat and is not considered threatened with extinction.</p>
<p>The species is mostly sedentary (non-<span>migratory</span>), but is thought to make some seasonal movements based upon local conditions related to the rainy seasons. In central <span>Burkina Faso</span> it is observed more frequently during the rainy season, and it has also been observed to be erratically absent or present in the <span>Kampala</span> region of Uganda.</p>
