<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h2>
<p><i>C. afra</i> are insectivorous bats feeding on a range of insects but particularly <span>coleoptera</span> and <span>lepidoptera</span>. Feeding is strongly dependent on the season with much greater feeding activity occurring during the rainy seasons.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Group_Structure">Group Structure</span></h2>
<p><i>C. afra</i> lives in caverns in groups exceeding 50,000. Within colonies there is social structure with <span>harems</span> of around 20 females being attended usually by a single male. While female juveniles will sometimes remain within the cluster they were born into, young males will disperse and join bachelor clusters.</p>
