<p>The <b>Brubru</b> (<i>Nilaus afer</i>) is a member of the <span>bushshrike</span> family found in much of <span>sub-Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span> apart from the western <span>rainforests</span> and southern <span>South Africa</span>. It is the only member of the genus <i>Nilaus</i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Its habitat is dry open woodland, but varies geographically. The six northern races and the subspecies <i>N. a. brubru</i> of southern Africa are found in <span>acacia</span> and broadleaved woodland, whereas the three subspecies in a belt from northeastern <span>Angola</span> and northern <span>Namibia</span> east to <span>Tanzania</span> and northern <span>Mozambique</span> occur in <i><span>Brachystegia</span></i> <span>miombo</span> woodland.</p>

</div>
<p>The Brubru is a small <span>passerine</span>, 12&#x2013;15&#xA0;cm long. The adult male of the nominate subspecies, <i>N. a. afer</i>, has a black crown, white <span>supercilium</span> and forehead, and black eyestripe. The back is black with a tawny strip, the rump is mottled black, and the tail is black with white tips and edges to the outer feathers. The wings are black with a buff shoulder stripe. The underparts are white with rufous flanks.</p>
<p>The female is duller and browner, with some streaking on the underparts and less rufous on the flanks. The juvenile is mottled brown, buff and white above, with buff edgings to the wing and tail feathers. Its underparts are whitish with brown barring.</p>
<p>The male of the most distinctive of the other subspecies, <i>N. a. nigritemporalis</i>, occurring in the central belt across Africa, has no supercilium and a white, not buff, shoulder patch. Other subspecies differ in the extent of the supercilium and rufous flanks, and the shade and degree of streaking of the underparts.</p>
<p>The song is a duet. The male gives a soft <i>prrrrruuu</i> call, often answered by the female's <i>eeeu</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Brubru is usually solitary or in pairs; it is a restless but unobtrusive arboreal species which hunts <span>insects</span> in the canopy. Its need for large trees in which to feed means that it has an unusually large territory for a bird of its size, typically 35 hectares. If insects are abundant, it will join <span>mixed-species feeding flocks</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>The flimsy cup nest is constructed from twigs, grass and spider webs in a tree fork, and decorated with <span>lichens</span>. It is very well camouflaged. The female normally lays two eggs, which are off-white, greenish or greyish blotched with grey or brown. Both sexes incubate for about 19 days to hatching. The chicks fledge in another 22 days but are dependent for about eight weeks.</p>
<p>This species often destroys its own nests, especially when disturbed.</p>
