<p>The <span>plumage</span> of the adult is mainly pale rufous, both above and below. The back, upperwing and flanks are barred with black. The breast has dark streaks and the head is streaked but has no malar stripe unlike the <span>Common</span> and <span>Lesser Kestrels</span>. The rump and tail are grey with black bars; the tail has a white tip. In flight, the whitish underwing contrasts with the darker body. The <span>iris</span> of the eye is whitish, distinguishing the bird from any similar species. The bill is mainly blue-grey and the feet and <span>cere</span> are yellow. <span>Juvenile</span> birds have rufous instead of grey on the tail, streaked flanks and a dark eye.</p>
<p>The bird is 29&#x2013;37&#xA0;cm (11&#x2013;15&#xA0;in) long with a wingspan of 68&#x2013;84&#xA0;cm (27&#x2013;33&#xA0;in) The southern <span>subspecies</span> <i>F. r. rupicoloides</i> weighs about 181&#x2013;334gr (.400&#x2013;.736&#xA0;lb). The form <i>F. r. arthuri</i> is smaller, weighing about 165&#x2013;252gr (.364&#x2013;.556&#xA0;lb). The northern subspecies <i>F. r. fieldi</i> is also small and is paler than the others.</p>
<p>The species is usually silent but has a shrill, repeated call.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_range">Habitat and range</span></h2>
<p>It occurs in open, arid areas where it inhabits <span>grassland</span>, <span>savannas</span> and <span>semi-desert</span>. It is often associated with <span>acacias</span>. It prefers areas where the ground cover is lower than 50&#xA0;cm. It is found from sea-level up to 2150 metres, particularly between 800 and 1800 metres.</p>
<p>It is fairly common and widespread in the southern parts of its range but is scarce and patchily distributed further north. The form <i>F. r. rupicoloides</i> breeds in <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, parts of <span>Angola</span> and <span>Zambia</span> and in much of <span>South Africa</span> apart from the wetter regions of the south and east. <i>F. r. arthuri</i> is found in <span>Kenya</span> and northern <span>Tanzania</span> while <i>F. r. fieldi</i> occurs in <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Eritrea</span>, northern <span>Somalia</span> and probably northern <span>Kenya</span>.</p>
<p>The total range covers about 3.5 million&#xA0;km. The population is stable and is likely to be in the order of 100,000 to 200,000 pairs. Most birds are sedentary but some are nomadic or dispersive.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h2>
<p>The Greater Kestrel usually hunts from an exposed perch such as a tree or rock. It also hovers like several other kestrels. It feeds mainly on <span>invertebrates</span> such as <span>grasshoppers</span>, <span>termites</span>, <span>beetles</span> and <span>solifugids</span>. It also takes <span>lizards</span> and sometimes small birds, <span>mammals</span> and <span>snakes</span>. It mainly catches prey on the ground. It is attracted to fires where it catches insects and other prey as they flee from the flames. Excess food may be cached underneath vegetation or stones.</p>

<p>The breeding season varies between different regions. In the south it lasts from July to April with a peak between September and December. Breeding takes place in all months in Kenya and Tanzania but is concentrated between April and July. The season lasts from April to August in Somalia.</p>
<p>Greater Kestrels use the old <span>nest</span> of another bird for breeding, such as that of a <span>Cape Crow</span> or <span>Pied Crow</span>. A typical site is between 2 and 20&#xA0;metres above the ground in a tree or sometimes on a telegraph pole or <span>pylon</span>. Two to seven <span>eggs</span> are laid with three or four being most common. They are <span>incubated</span> for 22 to 23 days, mainly by the female. The young birds <span>fledge</span> after 30 to 34 days and remain dependent on their parents for at least 26 days longer.</p>
