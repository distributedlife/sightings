<p>The <b>long-tailed jaeger</b> (<i>Stercorarius longicaudus</i>) (known as the <b>long-tailed skua</b> outside the Americas) is a <span>seabird</span> in the <span>skua</span> family <span>Stercorariidae</span>.</p>
<p>This is the smallest of the skua family at 38&#x2013;58&#xA0;cm (15&#x2013;23&#xA0;in), depending on season and age. However, much of this, up to 29&#xA0;cm (11&#xA0;in), is comprised by the tail which may include the 15&#xA0;cm (5.9&#xA0;in) tail streamers of the summer adult. The wingspan of this species ranges from 102 to 117&#xA0;cm (40 to 46&#xA0;in) and the body mass is 230&#x2013;444&#xA0;g (8.1&#x2013;15.7&#xA0;oz).</p>
<p>This species breeds in the high Arctic of <span>Eurasia</span> and <span>North America</span>, with major populations in <span>Russia</span>, <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Canada</span> and smaller populations around the rest of the <span>Arctic</span>. It is a <span>migrant</span>, wintering in the south <span>Atlantic</span> and <span>Pacific</span>. Passage juvenile birds sometimes hunt small prey in ploughed fields or golf-courses, and are typically quite fearless of humans.</p>

<p>They nest on dry <span>tundra</span> or higher fells laying two spotted olive-brown eggs. On the breeding grounds they can be heard making yelping and rattling sounds. Outside of the breeding season they spend most of their time over open ocean and have a harsh <i>kreeah</i> cry. This bird feeds on fish (mainly caught from other seabirds), smaller <span>birds</span>, food scraps, small mammals, fruit and carrion. On migration, long-tailed jaegers are more likely to catch their own food, and less likely to steal from <span>gulls</span> and <span>terns</span> than larger <span>species</span>.</p>
<p>This species is unmistakable as an adult, with grey back, dark primary wing feathers without a white "flash", black cap and very long tail. Adults often hover over their breeding territories. Juveniles are much more problematic, and are difficult to separate from <span>parasitic jaeger</span> over the sea. They are slimmer, longer-winged and more tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. However, they are usually colder toned than Arctic, with greyer shades, rather than brown.</p>
