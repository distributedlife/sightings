<p>The <b>king eider</b> (pronounced <span class="nowrap"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA"><span>/</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#x2C8;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>a&#x26A;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>.</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>d</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#x259;r</span></span><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA"><span>/</span></span></span>) (<i>Somateria spectabilis</i>) is a large <span>sea duck</span> that breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast <span>Europe</span>, <span>North America</span> and <span>Asia</span>. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes, and migrate to <span>Arctic</span> <span>tundra</span> to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.</p>
<p>The king eider <span>winters</span> in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern <span>Canada</span> and northern <span>Norway</span>. It also occurs annually off the northeastern <span>United States</span>, <span>Scotland</span> and <span>Kamchatka</span>. Breeding areas include the <span>Arctic coastal tundra</span> of the north coast of <span>Alaska</span>. This species dives for <span>benthic</span> invertebrates, such as <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>polychaete</span> worms, and <span>molluscs</span>, with <span>mussels</span> being a favoured food. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds.</p>
<p>This species is smaller than the <span>common eider</span>. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white breast and multicoloured head. The drake's call is a deep cooing, and hens give various croaks and quacks.</p>
<p>The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a "queen eider") is a brown <span>bird</span>, but can still be readily distinguished from all <span>ducks</span> except other <span>eider</span> species on size and structure. The head is shorter than in the common eider, and the feathering extension onto the bill is rounded, not triangular in shape.</p>
<p>An immature drake is typically all dark with a white breast and a yellow bill patch. Eclipse adult drakes are similar but lack the white breast.</p>
<p>The king eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Traditional_Uses">Traditional Uses</span></h2>
<p>The king eider, or <i>qengallek</i> in <span>Yup'ik</span>,is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the <span>Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta</span> in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand king eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds.</p>
