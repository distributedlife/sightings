<p>The <b>Siberian blue robin,</b> <i>Luscinia cyane,</i> is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> that was formerly classified as a member of the <span>thrush</span> family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to belong to the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family, Muscicapidae. It and similar small <span>European</span> species are often called <span>chats</span>. Recent research suggests that this species and some other East Asian members of <i>Luscinia</i> should be classified in a new <span>genus</span>, together with the <span>Japanese</span> and <span>Ry&#x16B;ky&#x16B; robins</span>.</p>
<p>This bird is a <span>migratory</span> insectivorous species breeding in eastern <span>Asia</span> across to <span>Japan</span>. It winters in southeast Asia and <span>Indonesia</span>.</p>
<p>The breeding habitat is <span>coniferous</span> forest with dense undergrowth, often beside rivers or at woodland edges. It feeds on the ground but is very 'skulking'. In winter, this bird also tends to stay in dense vegetation.</p>
<p>This species is larger than the <span>European robin</span>. The breeding male is unmistakable with blue upperparts and white underparts. The female is much drabber, with brown upperparts and whitish underparts. Her dark eye stands out against the paler brown face.</p>
<p>This species is a very rare <span>vagrant</span> to <span>Europe</span>, and has vagrant status even as far east as Pakistan.</p>
