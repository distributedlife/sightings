<p>The <b>white-throated robin-chat</b> or <b>white-throated robin</b> (<i>Cossypha humeralis</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Muscicapidae</span>. It is <span>endemic</span> to <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>. Its natural <span>habitats</span> are dry <span>savannah</span> and subtropical or tropical dry <span>shrubland</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The white-throated robin-chat is found in dry savannah woodland and shrubland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The white-throated robin-chat is mainly insectivorous but also eats small vertebrates and some plant material. Its diet includes <span>beetles</span>, <span>termites</span>, <span>ants</span>, <span>crickets</span>, <span>caterpillars</span>, <span>bugs</span>, <span>spiders</span> and <span>millipedes</span>. It also consumes the fruits of the <span>woolly caper-bush</span> (<i>Capparis tomentosa</i>), the <span>tassel-berry</span> (<i>Antidesma venosum</i>), the <span>sand raisin</span> (<i>Grewia microthyrsa</i>), the <span>magic guarrie</span> (<i>Euclea divinorum</i>) and the <span>dune guarrie</span> (<i>Euclea racemosa</i>).</p>
<p>Breeding takes place in the spring, principally in October and November. The nest is usually on or near the ground, in a hollow stump, near the root of a vine or in a discarded utensil. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, dry grasses and leaves and lined with rootlets, tendrils, stalks and fragments of leaves. There are usually two or three eggs and the incubation is done solely by the hen bird and lasts fourteen to fifteen days. Both parents feed the chicks, which leave the nest after about a fortnight but remain dependent on the adults for another six or seven weeks. The white-throated robin-chat is sometimes <span>parasitised</span> by the <span>red-chested cuckoo</span> <i>(Cuculus solitarius)</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The white-throated robin-chat is found in southern Africa. Its range includes parts of Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa and covers an area of approximately 645,000 square kilometres (249,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). Its population has not been quantified but it is common in much of its range and the population appears to be stable, so the <span>IUCN</span> lists it as being of "<span>Least Concern</span>".</p>
