<p>The <b>flesh-footed shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus carneipes</i>) is a medium-sized <span>shearwater</span>. Its plumage is black. It has pale pinkish feet, and a pale bill with a distinct black tip. Together with the equally light-billed <span>pink-footed shearwater</span>, it forms the <i>Hemipuffinus</i> group, a <span>superspecies</span> which may or may not have an <span>Atlantic</span> relative in the <span>great shearwater</span>. These are large shearwaters which are among those that could be separated in the genus <i>Ardenna</i>.</p>
<p>It breeds in colonies, and has two main breeding areas: one in the southwest <span>Pacific Ocean</span> includes <span>Lord Howe Island</span> (16,900 pairs ) and northern <span>New Zealand</span> (11,000 pairs ); the other is along the coast of <span>Western Australia</span> from <span>Cape Leeuwin</span> to the <span>Recherche Archipelago</span>. Another 500 pairs breed on <span>St Paul Island</span> in the <span>Indian Ocean</span>. There is an unconfirmed record of birds on <span>Astola Island</span> of <span>Pakistan</span> in the <span>Arabian Sea</span>. There is recent evidence to suggest populations are declining across much of the species range. The species was recently listed as 'Near Threatened' in Australia  and 'Nationally Vulnerable' in New Zealand  and has been recommended for listing under the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels.</p>
<p>The species occurs as a (Boreal) summer visitor in the <span>North Pacific Ocean</span> where potentially large numbers are taken as bycatch in fisheries. The species also suffers from climate related impacts  and significant heavy metal contamination, the cause of which is not fully understood but is likely due to the ingestion of significant quantities of plastic which the birds mistake for food floating on the ocean surface.</p>
