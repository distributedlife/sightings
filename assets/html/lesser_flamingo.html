<p>The <b>lesser flamingo</b> (<i>Phoenicopterus minor</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>flamingo</span> occurring in <span>sub-Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span> with another population in <span>India</span>. Birds are occasionally reported from further north, but these are generally considered <span>vagrants</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The lesser flamingo is the smallest species of flamingo, though it is a tall and largish bird by most standards. The species can weigh from 1.2 to 2.7&#xA0;kg (2.6 to 6.0&#xA0;lb). The standing height is around 80 to 90&#xA0;cm (31 to 35&#xA0;in). The total length (from <span>beak</span> to tail) and wingspan are in the same range of measurements, from 90 to 105&#xA0;cm (35 to 41&#xA0;in). Most of the plumage is pinkish white. The clearest difference between this species and the <span>greater flamingo</span>, the only other Old World species of flamingo, is the much more extensive black on the bill. Size is less helpful unless the species are together, since the sexes of each species also differ in height.</p>
<p>The lesser flamingo may be the most numerous species of flamingo, with a population that (at its peak) probably numbers up to two million individual birds. This species feeds primarily on <i><span>Spirulina</span></i>, <span>algae</span> which grow only in very <span>alkaline lakes</span>. Presence of flamingo herds near water bodies is indication of <span>sodic alkaline</span> water which is not suitable for irrigation use. Although blue-green in colour, the algae contain the <span>photosynthetic pigments</span> that give the birds their pink colour. Their deep bill is specialised for filtering tiny food items. The lesser flamingo also feeds on shrimp.</p>
<p>Lesser flamingos are prey to a variety of species, including <span>marabou storks</span>, <span>baboons</span>, <span>African fish eagles</span>, and wildcats.</p>

</div>
<p>In <span>Africa</span>, where they are most numerous, the lesser flamingos breed principally on the highly <span>caustic</span> <span>Lake Natron</span> in northern <span>Tanzania</span>. Their other African breeding sites are at <span>Etosha Pan</span>, <span>Sua Pan</span> and <span>Kamfers Dam</span>. The last confirmed breeding at <span>Aftout es Saheli</span> in coastal <span>Mauritania</span> was in 1965. Breeding occurred at <span>Lake Magadi</span> in <span>Kenya</span> in 1962 when Lake Natron was unsuitable due to flooding. In the early 20th century, breeding was also observed at <span>Lake Nakuru</span>.</p>
<p>The species also breeds in southwestern and southern <span>Asia</span>. In 1974, they bred at the <span>Rann of Kutch</span>, but since then only at the <span>Zinzuwadia</span> and <span>Purabcheria</span> <span>salt pans</span> in north-western <span>India</span>.</p>
<p>Like all flamingos, they lay a single chalky white <span>egg</span> on a mound they build of mud. Chicks join creches soon after hatching, sometimes numbering over a hundred thousand individuals. The creches are marshalled by a few adult birds who lead them by foot to fresh water, a journey that can reach over 20 miles (32&#xA0;km).</p>

<p>Despite being the most numerous species of flamingo, it is classified as <span>near-threatened</span> due to its declining population and the low number of breeding sites, some of which are threatened by human activities.</p>
<p>The population in the two key east African lakes, <span>Nakuru</span> and <span>Bogoria</span>, have been adversely affected in recent years by suspected <span>heavy metal</span> <span>poisoning</span>, while its primary African breeding area in <span>Lake Natron</span> is currently under threat by a proposed soda ash plant by <span>Tata Chemicals</span>. The only breeding site in South Africa, situated at <span>Kamfers Dam</span>, is threatened by pollution and encroaching development.</p>
<p>The lesser flamingo is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
