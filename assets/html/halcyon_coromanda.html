<p>The <b>ruddy kingfisher</b> (<i>Halcyon coromanda</i>) is a medium-sized <span>tree kingfisher</span> which is widely distributed in east and southeast <span>Asia</span>, ranging from <span>South Korea</span> and <span>Japan</span> in the north, south through the <span>Philippines</span> to the <span>Sunda Islands</span>, and west to <span>China</span> and <span>India</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, with birds in the northern part of the range migrating as far south as <span>Borneo</span> during winter. Locally common in southern parts of its range, the ruddy kingfisher is rare in Japan, where it is highly sought after by birders. Ruddy kingfishers inhabit forested areas from the temperate to tropical zones, often in thick jungles and rainforests.</p>
<p>Reaching approximately 25&#xA0;cm, the ruddy kingfisher has a very large, bright red bill and equally red legs. The body is rust red, generally deepening to purple at the tail. There is little <span>sexual dimorphism</span> though some sources state that male birds are somewhat brighter in plumage.</p>

<p>Like other kingfishers, ruddy kingfishers generally feed on fish, crustaceans, and large insects, though in areas with less running water, they are known to take frogs and other amphibians. Due to its preference for heavily forested areas, the kingfisher's high, descending call is more often heard than the bird itself is seen, and these birds generally travel singly or in pairs.</p>
<p>The binomial name recalls the <span>Coromandel Coast</span> of India.</p>
