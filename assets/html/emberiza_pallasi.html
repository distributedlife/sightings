<i>Emberiza pallas</i> <span>MHNT</span></div>

<p>The <b>Pallas's reed bunting</b> (<i>Emberiza pallasi</i>) (also known as <b>Pallas's bunting</b>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>bunting</span> family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the <span>finches</span>, Fringillidae.</p>
<p>It breeds across northern and central <span>Asia</span> across to <span>Mongolia</span>. It is a <span>migrant</span>, which winters in <span>south east Asia</span>. It is a very rare vagrant to <span>western Europe</span>, but has occurred as far west as <span>Great Britain</span>.</p>
<p>English comedian <span>Bill Oddie</span> identified the first bird in Britain.</p>
<p>It is common in <span>tundra</span> scrub by water, and also breeds in drier open areas such as open <span>larch</span> forest.</p>
<p>The Pallas's reed bunting is a small passerine bird, similar to a small <span>reed bunting</span>. It has a small seed-eater's bill. The male has a black head and throat, white neck collar and underparts, and a heavily streaked grey back (reed bunting has a browner back). The female is much duller, with a streaked brown head. It is less streaked below than female reed bunting.</p>
<p>The song of the cock is a repetitive <i>sherp</i>.</p>
<p>Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. The nest is in a bush. 2-5 eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of those of buntings.</p>
<p>This bird is named after the German zoologist <span>Peter Simon Pallas</span>.</p>
