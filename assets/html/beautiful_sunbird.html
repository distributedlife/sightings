<p>The <b>Beautiful Sunbird</b> (<i>Cinnyris pulchella</i>) (formerly placed in the <span>genus</span> <i>Nectarinia</i>), is a <span>sunbird</span>. The sunbirds are a group of very small <span>Old World</span> <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time.</p>
<p>The Beautiful Sunbird is a common breeder across sub-<span>Saharan</span> tropical <span>Africa</span>. One or two <span>eggs</span> are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. It is a seasonal <span>migrant</span> within its range.</p>
<p>Beautiful Sunbirds are tiny, only 10&#xA0;cm long, although the breeding male's long tail adds another 5&#xA0;cm. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding.</p>
<p>The adult male is mainly glossy green with a yellow and crimson breast band. He has long tail streamers. The female is greenish-brown above and yellowish below.</p>
<p>This species is found in a variety of open habitats with some trees, including savannah and hotel gardens.</p>
