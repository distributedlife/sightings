<p>The <b>white-rumped swift</b> (<i>Apus caffer</i>) is a small <span>swift</span>. Although this <span>bird</span> is superficially similar to a <span>house martin</span>, it is not closely related to that <span>passerine</span> species. The resemblances between the <span>swallows</span> and swifts are due to <span>convergent evolution</span> reflecting similar life styles.</p>
<p>Swifts have very short legs that they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground, and spend most of their lives in the air, feeding on <span>insects</span> that they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing.</p>
<p>White-rumped swifts breed in much of <span>sub-Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>, and have expanded into <span>Morocco</span> and southern <span>Spain</span>. The populations in Spain, Morocco and the south of Africa are <span>migratory</span>, although their wintering grounds are not definitively known. Birds in tropical Africa are resident apart from seasonal movements.</p>
<p>This species appropriates the nests of <span>little swifts</span> and those swallows which build retort-shaped nests. In Europe and north Africa, this usually means the <span>red-rumped swallow</span>, but south of the Sahara other species like <span>wire-tailed swallow</span> are also parasitised. The original owners of the nests are driven away, or the white-rumps settle in the nest and refuse to move. Once occupied, the nest is lined with feathers and saliva, and one or two eggs are laid.</p>
<p>The habitat of this species is dictated by that of its hosts, and is therefore normally man-made structures such as bridges and buildings.</p>
<p>This 14-15.5&#xA0;cm long species has, like its relatives, a short forked tail and long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a <span>boomerang</span>. It is entirely dark except for a pale throat patch and a narrow white rump. It is similar to the closely related Little Swift, but is slimmer, darker and has a more forked tail and a narrower white rump.</p>
<p>This is a quiet species compared to little swift, but a twittering trill is sometimes given.</p>
