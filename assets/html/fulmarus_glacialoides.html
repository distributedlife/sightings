<p>The <b>southern fulmar</b> (<i>Fulmarus glacialoides</i>) is a <span>seabird</span> of the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span>. Along with the <span>northern fulmar</span>, <i>F. glacialis</i>, it belongs to the <span>fulmar</span> genus <i>Fulmarus</i> in the family <span>Procellariidae</span>, the true <span>petrels</span>. It is also known as the <b>Antarctic fulmar</b> or <b>silver-grey fulmar</b>.</p>
<p>It is largely pale grey above and white below with a distinctive white patch on the wing. It breeds on the coast of <span>Antarctica</span> and on surrounding islands, moving north in winter. It nests in <span>colonies</span> on cliffs, laying a single <span>egg</span> on a ledge or crevice. Its diet includes <span>krill</span>, <span>fish</span> and <span>squid</span> picked from the water's surface.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a fairly large, bulky petrel, 45&#x2013;50&#xA0;cm (18&#x2013;20&#xA0;in) long with a wingspan of 110&#x2013;120&#xA0;cm (43&#x2013;47&#xA0;in). The male has an average weight of 795&#xA0;g (28.0&#xA0;oz) while the smaller female weighs around 740&#xA0;g (26&#xA0;oz). These weights increase to 1,005 and 932&#xA0;g (35.5 and 32.9&#xA0;oz) at the start of a shift <span>incubating</span> the eggs. The male has a <span>wing</span> length of 34&#xA0;cm (13&#xA0;in), <span>bill</span> length of 44.6&#xA0;mm (1.76&#xA0;in), <span>tarsus</span> length of 52.1&#xA0;mm (2.05&#xA0;in) and tail length of 12.4&#xA0;cm (4.88&#xA0;in). The female has a wing length of 33.9&#xA0;cm (13.3&#xA0;in), bill length of 43&#xA0;mm (1.69&#xA0;in), tarsus length of 51.5&#xA0;mm (2.03&#xA0;in) and tail length of 12.1&#xA0;cm (4.8&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>The bird flies with a mixture of shallow flaps and long glides, often looking down to scan the water. The wings are fairly broad and rounded and are held stiff. The <span>plumage</span> is mainly pale silvery-grey above and white below. The head is white with a pale grey <span>crown</span>. The wingtips are blackish with a large white patch and the wings have a dark rear edge. The legs and feet are pale blue. The <span>bill</span> is pink with a black tip and dark bluish <span>naricorns</span>. First-year birds have a more slender bill than the adults.</p>
<p>It is usually silent but has loud, cackling calls which are uttered at the nest or in feeding flocks. Courting birds produce soft droning and guttural croaking calls.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The species was first described in 1840 by the Scottish naturalist <span>Andrew Smith</span> based on a specimen collected at the <span>Cape of Good Hope</span>. It originally had the <span>binomial name</span> <i>Procellaria glacialoides</i> but was subsequently moved to the genus <i>Fulmarus</i> with its closest relative, the northern fulmar, <i>F. glacialis</i>. <span>Molecular data</span> suggests that the two species diverged during the <span>Pleistocene</span> epoch.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>There are colonies on a number of the islands around <span>Antarctica</span> such as the <span>South Sandwich Islands</span>, <span>South Orkney Islands</span>, <span>South Shetland Islands</span>, <span>Bouvet Island</span> and <span>Peter I Island</span>. The bird also breeds at several sites along the mainland coast of Antarctica.</p>
<p>At sea, it mainly occurs along the outer edge of the <span>pack ice</span> in summer with water temperatures of &#x2212;1.5 to 0.5&#xB0;C. In winter, it regularly ranges north to around 40&#xB0;S latitude. It occurs further north in the cool waters of the <span>Humboldt Current</span>, reaching <span>Peru</span>. Small numbers are seen off the coasts of <span>South Africa</span>, southern <span>Australia</span> and <span>New Zealand</span>. Many birds can be washed up on beaches after storms. There are several unconfirmed reports from the west coast of <span>North America</span>.</p>
<p>It is a common species with a population of at least 4 million individuals. About a million pairs breed on the South Sandwich Islands alone. The species is not thought to be at risk of extinction and is classed as <span>least concern</span> by <span>Birdlife International</span>.</p>

Egg of <i>Fulmarus glacialoides</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The breeding colonies may contain hundreds of birds and are on cliffs in ice-free areas with the birds arriving in October. The courtship display consists of a pair sitting alongside each other while calling, waving their heads and nibbling and <span>preening</span> each other. The nest is a shallow <span>scrape</span> lined with stone chips. It is built in a spot sheltered from the wind on a ledge or <span>scree</span> slope or in a crevice. A single, white <span>egg</span> is laid during late November or early December. It measures 76 by 51&#xA0;mm (2.99 by 2.01&#xA0;in) and weighs about 103&#xA0;g (3.6&#xA0;oz). It is <span>incubated</span> for about 45 days with both parents taking turns in stints of 3&#x2013;9 days. The <span>down feathers</span> of the young birds are initially white apart from a blue-grey wash on the mantle. The second set of down feathers is grey on the upperparts and flanks while the rest of the underparts and the forehead remain white. The young <span>fledge</span> after around 52 days. Poor weather can lead to high <span>mortality rates</span> among eggs and chicks and they are also preyed on by <span>skuas</span> and <span>sheathbills</span>. Breeding success increases as the parents mature, improving from 48% at age 6&#x2013;8 to 87% at age 18&#x2013;20.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Southern fulmars frequently gather in flocks, often with other species of seabird such as <span>Cape petrels</span>, when there is a concentration of food like a school of <span>krill</span> or around <span>whaling</span> ships and <span>trawlers</span>. Krill and other <span>crustaceans</span> are the most important component of the diet but the species also feeds on small <span>fish</span> such as the <span>Antarctic silverfish</span> and <span>squid</span> such as <i><span>Psychroteuthis</span></i>, <i><span>Gonatus</span></i> and <i><span>Galiteuthis</span></i>. Food is usually picked from the surface of the water but the bird will occasionally dive.</p>
