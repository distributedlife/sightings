<p>The <b>crimson-breasted shrike</b> (<i>Laniarius atrococcineus</i>) or the <b>crimson-breasted gonolek</b>, ('gonolek' - supposedly imitative of its call), is a southern African bird. The species is closely related to two other <span>bushshrikes</span>, the <span>yellow-crowned gonolek</span> (<i>Laniarius barbarus</i>) and the <span>black-headed gonolek</span> (<i>Laniarius erythrogaster</i>) of East Africa.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The species was first collected by <span>William John Burchell</span> in 1811 near the confluence of the <span>Vaal</span> and <span>Orange</span> Rivers. He named it <i>atrococcineus</i> meaning 'black/red', finding the striking colour combination quite remarkable. The generic name <i>Laniarius</i> was coined by the French ornithologist <span>Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</span> and was meant to call attention to the butcher-like habits of the group. In <span>South West Africa</span> its colours reminded Germans of their homeland flag and it therefore became the <i>Reichsvogel</i> ("Empire bird").</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The sexes have the same colouration and are indistinguishable from each other. A yellow-breasted form is occasionally seen, and was at first thought to be a separate species. Young birds have a mottled and barred buff-brown appearance with a pale bill.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>This shrike is extremely nimble and restless, its penetrating whistles often being the first sign of its presence, although it is not a shy species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The crimson-breasted shrike occurs in a broad swathe from southern <span>Angola</span> to the <span>Free State province</span> in <span>South Africa</span>. Its preferred habitat is drier thornbush areas, in thickets and riparian scrub. It makes small seasonal migrations, preferring lower altitudes during cold periods.</p>
