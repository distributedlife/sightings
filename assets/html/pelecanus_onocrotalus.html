<p>The <b>great white pelican</b> (<i>Pelecanus onocrotalus</i>) also known as the <b>eastern white pelican</b>, <b>rosy pelican</b> or <b>white pelican</b> is a <span>bird</span> in the <span>pelican</span> family. It breeds from southeastern <span>Europe</span> through <span>Asia</span> and in <span>Africa</span> in <span>swamps</span> and shallow lakes.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The great white pelican is a huge bird, with only the <span>Dalmatian pelican</span> averaging larger amongst the pelicans. The wingspan can range from 226 to 360&#xA0;cm (7.41 to 11.81&#xA0;ft), with the latter measurement the largest recorded among extant flying animals outside of the <span>great albatrosses</span>. The total length of the great white pelican can range from 140 to 180&#xA0;cm (55 to 71&#xA0;in), with the enormous bill comprising 28.9 to 47.1&#xA0;cm (11.4 to 18.5&#xA0;in) of that length. Adult males, weigh from 9 to 15&#xA0;kg (20 to 33&#xA0;lb), though large races from the <span>Palaearctic</span> are usually around 11&#xA0;kg (24&#xA0;lb) with few exceeding 13&#xA0;kg (29&#xA0;lb). Females are considerably less bulky and heavy, weighing from 5.4 to 9&#xA0;kg (12 to 20&#xA0;lb). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> length is 60 to 73&#xA0;cm (24 to 29&#xA0;in), the <span>tail</span> is 16 to 21&#xA0;cm (6.3 to 8.3&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 13 to 14.9&#xA0;cm (5.1 to 5.9&#xA0;in). The standard measurements from differing areas indicate that pelicans of the species from the <span>Western Palaearctic</span> are somewhat larger in size than ones that reside in <span>Asia</span> and in <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Immature great white pelicans are grey and have dark flight <span>feathers</span>. In flight, it is an elegant soaring bird, with the head held close to and aligned with the body by a downward bend in the neck. In breeding condition the male has pinkish skin on its face and the female has orangey skin. It differs from the Dalmatian pelican by its pure white, rather than greyish-white, plumage, a bare pink facial patch around the eye and pinkish legs. Males are larger than females, and have a long beak that grows in a downwards arc, as opposed to the shorter, straighter beak of the female. The <span>spot-billed pelican</span> of Asia is slightly smaller than the great white, with clear brownish-grey plumage and a paler, duller-colored bill. Similarly, the <span>pink-backed pelican</span> is smaller with brownish-grey plumage, with a light pink to off-grey bill and a pinkish wash to the back.</p>
<p>The great white pelican is well adapted for <span>aquatic</span> life. The short strong legs and webbed feet propel it in water and aid the rather awkward takeoff from the water surface. Once aloft, the long-winged pelicans are powerful fliers, however, and often travel in spectacular V-formation groups.</p>

<p>Great white pelicans are usually birds found in and around shallow, (seasonally or tropical) warm <span>fresh water</span>. Well scattered groups of breeding pelicans occur through Eurasia from the eastern <span>Mediterranean</span> to <span>Vietnam</span>. In Eurasia, fresh or <span>brackish waters</span> may be inhabited and the pelicans may be found in <span>lakes</span>, <span>deltas</span>, <span>lagoons</span> and <span>marshes</span>, usually with <span>dense reedbeds</span> nearby for nesting purposes. Additionally, sedentary populations are found year-round in <span>Africa</span>, south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span> although these are patchy. In Africa, great white pelicans occur mainly around <span>freshwater</span> and <span>alkaline lakes</span> and may also be found in coastal, estuarine areas. Beyond reedbeds, African pelicans have nested on <span>inselbergs</span> and flat inshore islands off of <span>Banc d'Arguin National Park</span>. Migratory populations are found from <span>Eastern Europe</span> to <span>Kazakhstan</span> during the breeding season. More than 50% of Eurasian great white pelicans breed in the <span>Danube Delta</span> in <span>Romania</span>. They like to stay also in the <span>Lakes</span> near <span>Burgas</span>, <span>Bulgaria</span> and in <span>Srebarna Lake</span> in <span>Bulgaria</span>. The pelicans arrive in the Danube in late March or early April and depart after breeding from September to late November. Wintering locations for European pelicans are not exactly known but wintering birds may occur in northeastern Africa through <span>Iraq</span> to <span>north India</span>, with a particularly large number of breeders from Asia wintering around <span>Pakistan</span>. These are birds that are found mostly in lowlands, though in <span>East Africa</span> and <span>Nepal</span> may be found living at elevations of up to 1,372&#xA0;m (4,501&#xA0;ft).</p>

<p>The diet of the great white pelican consists mainly of <span>fish</span>. The pelicans leave their roost to feed early in the mornings and may fly over 100&#xA0;km (62&#xA0;mi) in search of food, as has been observed in <span>Chad</span> and <span>Mogode, Cameroon</span>. Each pelican needs from 0.9 to 1.4&#xA0;kg (2.0 to 3.1&#xA0;lb) of fish every day. This corresponds to around 28,000,000&#xA0;kg (62,000,000&#xA0;lb) of fish consumed every year at the largest colony of great white pelicans, on <span>Tanzania</span>'s <span>Lake Rukwa</span>, with almost 75,000 birds. Fish targeted are usually fairly large ones, in the 500&#x2013;600&#xA0;g (1.1&#x2013;1.3&#xA0;lb) weight range, and are taken based on regional abundance. <span>Common carp</span> are preferred in <span>Europe</span>, <span>mullet</span> are preferred in <span>China</span> and <i>Aphanius dispar</i> (a <span>carp</span>) are preferred in <span>India</span>. In <span>Africa</span>, often the commonest <span>cichlids</span>, including many species in the <i><span>Haplochromis</span></i> and <i><span>Tilapia</span></i> genera, seem to be preferred. The pelican's pouch serves simply as a scoop. As the pelican pushes its bill underwater, the lower bill bows out, creating a large pouch which fills with water and fish. As the <span>bird</span> lifts its head, the pouch contracts, forcing out the water but retaining the fish. A group of 6 to 8 great white pelicans will gather in a horseshoe formation in the water to feed together. They dip their bills in unison, creating a circle of open pouches, ready to trap every fish in the area. Most feeding is cooperative and done in groups, especially in shallow waters where fish schools can be corraled easily, though these pelicans may forage alone as well.</p>
<p>Pelicans are not restricted to fish, however, and are often opportunistic foragers. In some situations they eat chicks of other birds, such as the well documented case off the southwest coast of South Africa. Here breeding Pelicans from the Dassen Island colony predate chicks weighing up to 2&#xA0;kg (4.4&#xA0;lb) from the <span>Cape gannet</span> colony on <span>Malgas Island</span>. Similarly, in <span>Walvis Bay, Namibia</span> the eggs and chicks of <span>Cape cormorants</span> are fed regularly to young pelicans. The local pelican population is so reliant on the cormorants, that when the cormorant species experienced a population decline, the numbers of pelicans appeared to decline as well. Great white pelicans also eat <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>tadpoles</span> and even <span>turtles</span>. They readily accept handouts from humans, and a number of unusual items have been recorded in their diet. During periods of <span>starvation</span>, pelicans also eat <span>seagulls</span> and <span>ducklings</span>. The gulls are held under water and drowned before being eaten headfirst. Pelicans will also <span>rob other birds</span> of their prey.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>The breeding season commences in April or May in temperate zones, essentially all year around in Africa and begins in February through April in India. Large numbers of these pelicans breed together in colonies. The female can lay from 1 to 4 eggs in a clutch, with two being the average. Nest locations are variable. Some populations making stick nests in trees but a majority, including all those who breed in Africa, nest exclusively in scrapes on the ground lined with grass, sticks, feathers and other material. The young are cared for by both parents. The incubation stage lasts for 29 to 36 days. The chicks are naked when they hatch but quickly sprout blackish-brown down. The colony gathers in "pods" around 20 to 25 days after the eggs hatch. The young fledge at 65 to 75 days of age. Around 64% of young successful reach adulthood, with sexual maturity attained at 3 to 4 years of age. White pelicans are often protected from <span>bird-eating raptors</span> by virtue of their own great size, but <span>eagles</span>, especially sympatric <i><span>Haliaeetus</span></i> species, may predate their eggs, nestlings and fledgings. Occasionally, pelicans and their young are attacked at their colonies by <span>mammalian carnivores</span> from <span>jackals</span> to <span>lions</span>. As is common in pelicans, the close approach of a large predaceous or unknown mammal, including a human, at a colony will lead the pelican to abandon their nest in self-preservation. Additionally, <span>crocodiles</span>, especially <span>Nile crocodiles</span> in Africa, will readily kill and eat swimming pelicans.</p>

<p>Today, because of <span>overfishing</span> in certain areas, White pelicans are forced to fly long distances to find food. Great white pelicans are exploited for many reasons. Their pouch is used to make tobacco bags, Their skin is turned into <span>leather</span>, the <span>guano</span> is used as <span>fertiliser</span>, and the fat of young pelicans is converted into oils for traditional medicine in <span>China</span> and <span>India</span>. In <span>Ethiopia</span>, great white pelicans are shot for their meat. Human disturbance, loss of foraging habitat and breeding sites, and <span>pollution</span> are all contributing to the decline of the great white pelican. Declines have been particularly notable in the <span>Palearctic</span>.</p>
<p>The great white pelican is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. The great white pelican is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List 2006 and is listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species. It is listed on Appendix II of the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and on Annex I of the EC Birds Directive. Overall, though, the great white pelican is still the most widely distributed species. Although some areas still hold quite large colonies, it ranks behind the <span>brown pelican</span> and possibly the <span>Australian pelican</span> in overall abundance. Europe now holds an estimated 7,345&#x2013;10,000 breeding pairs, with over 4,000 pairs that are known to nest in <span>Russia</span>. During migration, more than 75,000 have been observed in <span>Israel</span> and, in winter, over 45,000 may stay in Pakistan. In all its colonies combined, 75,000 pairs are estimated to nest on the African continent.</p>
<p>This species is often kept in captivity, in zoos or in semi-wild colonies such as that in <span>St. James's Park</span>, London. The ancestors of this colony were originally given to <span>Charles II</span> by the Russian Ambassador in 1664 which initiated the tradition of ambassadors donating the birds.</p>
