<p>The <b>Moorland Chat</b> (<i>Cercomela sordida</i>), also known as the <b>Alpine Chat</b> or <b>Hill Chat</b>, is a species of songbird in the Old World Flycatcher <span>family</span>. It is <span>endemic</span> to north-east <span>Africa</span> where it is common in its habitat. It lives at high altitudes on <span>moors</span> and <span>grassland</span>, usually above 3,400&#xA0;m (11,100&#xA0;ft), but can live as low as 2,100&#xA0;m (6,900&#xA0;ft). It has a short tail and long legs. It is bold and will approach people.</p>
<p>The chat was first discovered on <span>Mount Elgon</span> on the <span>Uganda</span>-<span>Kenya</span> border by Jackson. <span>Mackinder</span> brought back the same bird from <span>Mount Kenya</span> in 1899. He presented a paper on the first ascent to the <span>Royal Geographical Society</span> in 1900. The scientific results of his expedition were discussed in detail afterwards.</p>

<p>A very curious little bird was found by Mr Jackson on Mount Elgon at a height of 11,000 feet, and I remember saying to Mr. Mackinder that he was bound to find the same sort of little chat on Mount Kenya, at a height of 11,000 feet. This he did, and it was the same species as the Mount Elgon bird, an ordinary-looking little brown chat, with a good deal of white in the tail.</p>
