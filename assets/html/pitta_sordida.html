<p>The <b>hooded pitta</b> (<i>Pitta sordida</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. It is common in eastern and southeastern <span>Asia</span> and <span>Maritime Southeast Asia</span>, where it lives in different types of forests as well as on plantations and other cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Hooded pittas can reach a length of 16 to 19&#xA0;cm and a weight of 42 to 70&#xA0;g. Their diet consists of various <span>insects</span> (including their <span>larvae</span>), which they hunt on the ground, and <span>berries</span>. In the breeding period, which lasts from February to August, they build nests on the ground; both parent take care of the eggs and the fledglings. They are highly territorial and their fluty double-noted whistle calls ("qweeek-qweeek") can be constantly heard from their territories, sometimes throughout the nights.</p>
<p>In captivity, hooded pittas mix well with other species although may be aggressive toward other pittas when breeding. In the <span>London Zoo</span>, they are kept in a large walk through aviary in the restored Blackburn Pavilion bird house, while at the <span>Durrell Wildlife park</span> they are in a large walk-through exhibit with birds such as <span>Palawan peacock-pheasants</span> and <span>white-rumped shamas</span>.</p>
