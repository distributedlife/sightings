<p>The <b>Pallas's gull</b> or <b>great black-headed gull</b> (<i>Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus</i>) is a large <span>gull</span>. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus <i><span>Larus</span></i>.</p>
<p>This species breeds in colonies in marshes and islands from southern <span>Russia</span> to <span>Mongolia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in the eastern <span>Mediterranean</span>, <span>Arabia</span> and <span>India</span>. This gull nests on the ground, laying between two and four eggs.</p>
<p>It occurs in western <span>Europe</span> only as a rare vagrant. In <span>Great Britain</span> a recent review left a single occurrence in 1859 as the only acceptable record of this bird. The species also occurs as a vagrant in differing parts of the <span>Indian Ocean</span>, south of its normal range, and along the northern and eastern coasts of <span>Africa</span>, where it visits annually on an irregular basis.</p>

A juvenile great black-headed gull.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a very large gull, being easily the world's largest black-headed gull and the third largest species of gull in the world, after the <span>great black-backed gull</span> and the <span>glaucous gull</span>. It measures 55&#x2013;72&#xA0;cm (22&#x2013;28&#xA0;in) in length with a 142 to 170&#xA0;cm (56 to 67&#xA0;in) wingspan. Weight can vary from 0.96&#x2013;2.1&#xA0;kg (2.1&#x2013;4.6&#xA0;lb), with an average of 1.6&#xA0;kg (3.5&#xA0;lb) in males and 1.22&#xA0;kg (2.7&#xA0;lb) in females. Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 43.5 to 52&#xA0;cm (17.1 to 20.5&#xA0;in), the bill is 4.7 to 7.3&#xA0;cm (1.9 to 2.9&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 6.5 to 8.4&#xA0;cm (2.6 to 3.3&#xA0;in). Summer adults are unmistakable, since no other gull of this size has a black hood. The adults have grey wings and back, with conspicuous white "mirrors" at the wing tips. The legs are yellow and the bill is red.</p>
<p>In all other plumages, a dark mask through the eye indicates the vestiges of the hood. The call is a deep <i>aargh</i> cry. Young birds attain largely grey upperparts quite rapidly, but they take four years to reach maturity.</p>
<p>These birds are predatory, taking fish, crustaceans, insects and even small mammals.</p>
<p>The Pallas's gull is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>This bird has a deep, rather nasal flight-call which resembles the call of the <span>lesser black-backed gull</span>. Although they are noisy at colonies, Pallas's gulls are mostly silent when breeding.</p>
