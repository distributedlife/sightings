<p>The <b>Bateleur</b> (<i>Terathopius ecaudatus</i>) is a medium-sized <span>eagle</span> in the family <i>Accipitridae</i>. Its closest relatives are the snake eagles. It is the only member of the <span>genus</span> <i>Terathopius</i> and may be the origin of the "<span>Zimbabwe bird</span>", national emblem of <span>Zimbabwe</span>. It is endemic to Africa and small parts of Arabia. "<i>Bateleur</i>" is <span>French</span> for "Street Performer".</p>

An immature captive Bateleur</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The average adult is 55 to 70&#xA0;cm (22 to 28&#xA0;in) long with a 186&#xA0;cm (6&#xA0;ft 1&#xA0;in) wingspan. The wing chord averages approximately 51&#xA0;cm (20&#xA0;in). Adult weight is typically 2 to 2.6&#xA0;kg (4&#xA0;lb 7&#xA0;oz to 5&#xA0;lb 12&#xA0;oz).</p>
<p>The Bateleur is a colourful <span>species</span> with a very short tail (<i>ecaudatus</i> is <span>Latin</span> for tailless) which, together with its white underwing coverts, makes it unmistakable in flight. The tail is so small the bird's legs protrude slightly beyond the tail during flight. The Bateleur is sexually dimorphic; both adults have black plumage, a <span>chestnut</span> mantle and tail, grey shoulders, tawny wing coverts, and red facial skin, bill and legs. The female additionally has tawny secondary wing feathers. Less commonly, the mantle may be white. Immature birds are brown with white dappling and have greenish facial skin. It takes them seven or eight years to reach full maturity.</p>
<p>The Bateleur is diurnal, and hunts over a territory of approximately 250 square miles (650&#xA0;km) a day. Bateleurs are hunters and scavengers; birds such as pigeons and sangrouse are preferred prey items, although it may attack small mammals and also takes carrion. The Bateleur is generally silent, but on occasions it produces a variety of <span>barks and screams</span>. The bird spends a considerable amount of time on the wing, particularly in low-altitude glides. "<i>Bateleur</i>" is <span>French</span> for "Street Performer"  which included performers such as <span>tight-rope walkers</span>. This name implies the bird&#x2019;s characteristic habit of rocking its <span>wings</span> from side to side when gliding, as if catching its balance.</p>

<p>The Bateleur breeds in December&#x2013;March. It constructs a well-concealed nest in <span>trees</span>, laying a single <span>egg</span> which is incubated by the female for 42 to 43 days, with a further 90 to 125 days until fledging. Bateleurs pair for life, and will use the same nest for a number of years. Unpaired birds, presumably from a previous clutch, will sometimes help at the nest.</p>
<p>Bateleur eagles are among a group of raptors that secrete a clear, salty fluid from their <span>nares</span> whilst eating. According to Schmidt-Nielson's (1964) hypothesis, this is due to the general necessity for birds to use an extrarenal mechanism of salt secretion to aid water reabsorption.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_Habitat">Distribution and Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Bateleur eagle is a common to fairly common resident of the open <span>savanna</span> country and woodland (<span>thornveld</span>) within <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>; it also occurs in south-west <span>Arabia</span>. Total distribution size is estimated at 28,000,000&#xA0;km. The bird's range has diminished significantly in recent decades, possibly due to poisoning.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>In 2009, the Bateleur was placed in the <span>Near-Threatened</span> <span>IUCN</span> Red List Category due to loss of <span>habitat</span>, <span>pesticides</span>, capture for international trade and nest disturbance. Decline of the species is suspected to have been moderately rapid over the past three generations. Current <span>conservation</span> efforts are unknown. Like the <span>Martial Eagle</span>, the Bateleur is reasonably common in conservation areas and scarce elsewhere.</p>
<p>Global population is estimated at 10,000 to 100,000 individuals.</p>
