<p>The <b>imperial shag</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax atriceps</i>) is a black and white <span>cormorant</span> native to many <span>subantarctic</span> <span>islands</span>, the <span>Antarctic Peninsula</span> and southern <span>South America</span>, primarily in rocky coastal regions, but locally also at large inland lakes. It is sometimes placed in the <span>genus</span> <i>Leucocarbo</i> instead. It is also known as the <b>blue-eyed shag</b>, <b>blue-eyed cormorant</b> and by many other names, and is one of a larger group of cormorants called <span>blue-eyed shags</span>. The <span>taxonomy</span> is very complex, and several <span>subspecies</span> are often considered separate species.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The taxonomy is very complex and <span>species</span>-limits within this group remain unresolved. The following are usually considered part of this group:</p>

</div>
<p>While some authorities accept all of the above &#x2013; except <i>albiventer</i> &#x2013; as separate species, others consider all as subspecies of a single species (as done in this article). Alternatively, some recognize two species, the white-cheeked <i>P. atriceps</i> (with subspecies <i>bransfieldensis</i>, <i>nivalis</i> and <i>georgianus</i>) and the black-cheeked <i>P. albiventer</i> (with subspecies <i>melanogenis</i> and <i>purpurascens</i>), or it has been suggested that three species should be recognized: <i>P. atriceps</i> (including <i>albiventer</i>), <i>P. georgianus</i> (with subspecies <i>bransfieldensis</i> and <i>nivalis</i>), and <i>P. melanogenis</i> (with subspecies <i>purpurascens</i> and possibly <i>verrucosus</i>, though the latter is relatively distinctive, and most consider it a separate species, the <span>Kerguelen shag</span>).</p>

An immature <i>P. (a.) albiventer</i> in <span>Patagonia</span>, Argentina</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The imperial shag has a total length of 70&#x2013;79&#xA0;cm (28&#x2013;31&#xA0;in) and weighs 1.8&#x2013;3.5&#xA0;kg (4.0&#x2013;7.7&#xA0;lb), with males averaging larger than females. It is endowed with glossy black feathers covering most of its body, with a white belly and neck. It possesses a distinctive ring of blue skin around its eyes, an orange-yellow nasal knob, pinkish legs and feet, and an erectile black crest. During the non-breeding season, adults lack the crest, have a duller facial area, and less/no white to the back/wings. It has a serrated bill used for catching fish.</p>
<p>The subspecies vary primarily in the amount of white on the cheeks/ear-coverts, <span>wing-coverts</span> and back. Most <span>taxa</span> have white cheeks and ear-coverts, but these are black in <i>albiventer</i>, <i>purpurascens</i> and <i>melanogenis</i>. Chicks are uniform brownish, and immatures are brownish and white (instead of black and white), have dull facial skin, and lack the orange-yellow nasal knob and blue eye-ring.</p>

A large colony of <i>P. (a.) albiventer</i> at the Beagle Channel, Argentina. Notice the numerous all-brownish chicks.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a <span>colonial</span>, <span>monogamous</span> species. The colonies are usually relatively small, but some consist of hundreds of pairs and are often shared with other seabirds such as <span>rock shags</span>, <span>southern rockhopper penguins</span> and <span>black-browed albatrosses</span>. Up to five eggs (usually two or three) are placed in a nest made of seaweed and grass, and cemented together with mud and excrement. The eggs usually hatch in about five weeks, and are brooded by both parents. Many chicks and eggs are lost to predators such as <span>skuas</span> and <span>sheathbills</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The diet of this species consists of small <span>benthic</span> fish, <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>polychaetes</span>, <span>gastropods</span> and <span>octopuses</span>. The South American populations primarily feed on fish, especially <span>Argentine anchoita</span>, while <i>P. (a) nivalis</i> primarily feeds on fish and <span>polychaetes</span>. Mean diving depth for the South American populations is almost 25&#xA0;m (82&#xA0;ft), while the mean for <i>P. (a) nivalis</i> is 5&#xA0;m (16&#xA0;ft) and a maximum of 60&#xA0;m (200&#xA0;ft). Most feeding takes place in inshore regions, but at least some populations (e.g. the South American populations) will travel some distance from the shore to fish.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>Overall this species is not considered <span>threatened</span> and is consequently listed as <span>Least Concern</span> by <span>BirdLife International</span> and <span>IUCN</span>. Most subspecies are relatively common with estimates of over 10,000 pairs of each, the exceptions being <i>P. (a.) nivalis</i> with approximately 1,000 pairs and <i>P. (a.) purpurascens</i> with approximately 760 pairs (has perhaps declined slightly from this figure in recent years). If these are considered separate species, it is likely one &#x2013; or both &#x2013; would qualify for a threatened status, and they are considered <span>Vulnerable</span> by <span>DEWHA</span>. Due to their small ranges and relatively small populations, they are highly susceptible to pollution, <span>climate changes</span>, and chance events such as storms. Deaths due to strikes with radio masts have been recorded in both, and are quite common in <i>P. (a.) purpurascens</i>. <span>Introduced predators</span> potentially also present a serious threat, though none are currently present on Heard Island and cats have been <span>eradicated</span> from Macquarie Island, leaving "only" <span>rats</span>, which, however, have been observed at nests of <i>P. (a.) purpurascens</i>.</p>

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><b><span>^</span></b></span> <span class="reference-text">The validity of <i>albiventer</i> is questionable, and some recent authorities consider it only a black-cheeked <span>morph</span> of <i>atriceps</i> (<i><span>sensu stricto</span></i>). This black-cheeked type occurs together with "normal" white-cheeked <i>atriceps</i> at some localities in southern mainland South America. There are no known behavioral isolating mechanism between the two and <span>hybrids</span> do occur.</span></li>
