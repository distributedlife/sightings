<p>The <b>Cape rockjumper</b> or <b>rufous rockjumper</b> (<i>Chaetops frenatus</i>) is a medium-sized insectivorous <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> endemic to the mountain <span>fynbos</span> of southernmost <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>This is a ground-nesting species which forages on rocky slopes and scree. It frequently perches on rocks. Breeding groups occupy 4&#x2013;11 ha territories, and typically consist of a breeding pair and one or two additional individuals, usually offspring of the adult pair from the preceding breeding season. These helpers participate in territorial defence and alarm calling, and in the feeding of nestlings and fledglings of the breeding pair. Females also help with nest building and incubation.</p>
<p>This <span>rockjumper</span> is 23&#x2013;25&#xA0;cm long with a long black tail and strong legs. The male has a dark grey head with a thin white <span>supercilium</span> and a broad white moustache. The back and wings are dark grey, and the underparts and rump are rufous red.</p>
<p>The female and juvenile have a paler grey head, upperparts and wings, a duller head pattern, an orange rump, and buff underparts. The call is a loud <i>wheeoo</i>.</p>
<p>The closely related <span>Drakensberg rockjumper</span>, <i>Chaetops aurantius</i>, does not overlap in range. The male of that species has orange underparts, and the female and young are paler below than the rufous rock-jumper.</p>
