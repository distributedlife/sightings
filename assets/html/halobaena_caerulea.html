<p>The <b>blue petrel</b> (<i>Halobaena caerulea</i>) is a small <span>seabird</span> in the <span>family</span> <i><span>Procellariidae</span></i>. This small <span>petrel</span> is the only member of the <span>genus</span> <i>Halobaena</i> but is closely allied to the <span>prions</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The blue petrel is the only bird from the <span>genus</span> <i>Halobaena</i>, and a member of the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>petrel</i> is derived from <b><span>St. Peter</span></b> and the story of his walking on water. This is in reference to the petrels habit of appearing to run on the water to take off.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The blue petrel's <span>plumage</span> is white underneath and grey on its upper parts, with an "M" banding across its top, which is similar to the <span>prion</span>'s. It also has a white-tipped tail. Its <span>bill</span> is smaller than prions.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>They feed predominantly on <span>krill</span>, as well as other <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>fish</span>, and <span>squid</span>. They can dive up to at 6&#xA0;m (20&#xA0;ft).</p>

<p>The blue petrel like all members of the <span>Procellariiformes</span> are <span>colonial</span>, and have large colonies. Their nest is a burrow, and they lay one <span>egg</span>. Both parents <span>incubate</span> the egg for approximately 50 day and the chick <span>fledges</span> after 55 days. <span>Skua</span> are the main danger for their eggs and chicks.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>They inhabit the southern <span>oceans</span> ranging as far north as <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Australia</span> and portions of <span>South America</span>. They will nest on <span>subantarctic</span> islands, such as <span>Marion Island</span>, the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, <span>Macquarie Island</span>, <span>South Georgia</span>, <span>Prince Edward Island</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The blue petrel has a very large range and an estimate population of 3,000,000 adult birds and thus it is rated as <span>Least Concern</span>, by the IUCN.</p>
