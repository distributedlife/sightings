<p>The <b>Cape shoveler</b> (<i>Anas smithii</i>) formerly known as <b>Cape shoveller</b> is a species of <span>dabbling duck</span> of the genus <i>Anas</i>. It is resident in <span>South Africa</span>, and uncommon further north in <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, southern <span>Angola</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, and <span>Zambia</span>.</p>
<p>This 51&#x2013;53&#xA0;cm long <span>duck</span> is <span>non-migratory</span>, but undertakes some local seasonal movements. It is gregarious when not breeding, and may then form large flocks.</p>
<p>This species has a large spatulate bill. Adults have speckled grey-brown plumage and dull orange legs. As with many southern hemisphere ducks, the sexes appear similar, but the male has a paler head than the female, a pale blue forewing separated from the green <span>speculum</span> by a white border, and yellow eyes. The female's forewing is grey.</p>
<p>Cape shoveler can only be confused with a vagrant female <span>northern shoveler</span>, but is much darker and stockier than that species.</p>
<p>It is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some <span>emergent vegetation</span>, and feeds by dabbling for plant food, often by swinging its bill from side to side to strain food from the water. This bird also eats <span>molluscs</span> and <span>insects</span> in the <span>nesting season</span>. The <span>nest</span> is a shallow depression on the ground, lined with plant material and down, and usually close to water.</p>
<p>This is a fairly quiet species. The male has <i>rarr</i> and <i>cawick</i> calls, whereas the female has a <i>quack</i>.</p>
<p>The binomial name of this bird commemorates the zoologist <span>Andrew Smith</span>.</p>
<p>The status of the Cape shoveler is <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
