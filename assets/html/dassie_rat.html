<p>The <b>dassie rat</b> (<i>Petromus typicus</i>) is an <span>African</span> <span>rodent</span> found among rocky outcroppings. It is the only living member of its genus, <i><b>Petromus</b></i>, and family, <b>Petromuridae</b>. The name "<span>dassie</span>" means "<span>hyrax</span>" in <span>Afrikaans</span>, and the two animals are found in similar habitats. <i>Petromus</i> means "rock mouse" and dassie rats are one of many rodents sometimes called <b>rock rats</b>. The family and genus names are sometimes misspelled as <b>Petromyidae</b> and <i><b>Petromys</b></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>Dassie rats are <span>squirrel</span>-like in appearance. Their <span>tails</span> are hairy, but not bushy whereas the <span>soles</span> of their feet are distinctly bare and have pads. Their heads are noticeably flattened. The overall coloration can be a range of browns, greys, or almost black. The nose is yellowish and tends to stand out. They have no underfur. The <span>teats</span> are located on the sides of the torso, which allows the young to feed from the side when crammed in a narrow rock crevice.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_history">Natural history</span></h2>
<p>Dassie rats are restricted to rocky outcrops in <span>Namibia</span>, parts of <span>Angola</span>, and northwest <span>South Africa</span>. They are famous for being able to squeeze into extremely narrow crevices. This is accomplished due to their flattened skulls and flexible ribs.</p>
<p>Dassie rats feed primarily on <span>grasses</span>, but will sometimes eat <span>fruits</span>, seeds, and <span>leaves</span>. They have high crowned and rooted cheek teeth. Females give birth to a pair of offspring just once a year, an unusually slow reproductive rate among rodents.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relatives">Relatives</span></h2>
<p>Dassie rats are the only remaining members of a once-diverse family that first appeared in the <span>Oligocene</span> of Africa. Both <span>morphological</span> and <span>molecular</span> studies suggest the closest living relatives to the dassie rats are the African <span>cane rats</span> in the family Thryonomyidae. These two families, along with related fossil families such as &#x2020;<span>Phiomyidae</span>, represented an important early radiation of rodents in Africa.</p>
