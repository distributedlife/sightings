<p>The <b>purple heron</b> (<i>Ardea purpurea</i>) is a wading <span>bird</span> in the <span>heron</span> family <span>Ardeidae</span>, breeding in <span>Africa</span>, central and southern <span>Europe</span>, and southern and eastern <span>Asia</span>. The European populations are <span>migratory</span>, wintering in tropical Africa; the more northerly Asian populations also migrate further south within Asia. It is a rare but regular wanderer north of its breeding range.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The purple heron is a large bird, 78&#x2013;97&#xA0;cm (31&#x2013;38&#xA0;in) in length with a standing height from 70 to 94&#xA0;cm (28 to 37&#xA0;in) and a 120&#x2013;152&#xA0;cm (47&#x2013;60&#xA0;in) wingspan. However, it is slender for its size, weighing only 0.5&#x2013;1.35&#xA0;kg (1.1&#x2013;3.0&#xA0;lb). It is somewhat smaller than the <span>grey heron</span>, from which it can be distinguished by its darker reddish-brown <span>plumage</span>, and, in adults, darker grey back. It has a narrower yellow bill, which is brighter in breeding adults. The most similarly-colored heron is the <span>Goliath heron</span>, which is considerably larger.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>There are three or four <span>subspecies</span>:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The purple heron breeds in <span>colonies</span> in <span>reed beds</span> or trees close to large lakes or other extensive wetlands. It builds a bulky stick nest.</p>
<p>It feeds in shallow water, spearing <span>fish</span>, <span>frogs</span>, <span>insects</span>, <span>spiders</span>, small <span>birds</span>, <span>rodents</span>, <span>salamanders</span>, and <span>snakes</span>. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim. It tends to keep within reed beds more than the <span>grey heron</span>, and is often inconspicuous, despite its size.</p>
<p>It has a slow flight, with its neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and <span>bitterns</span>, and distinguishes them from <span>storks</span>, <span>cranes</span> and <span>spoonbills</span>, which extend their necks. The long neck of the purple heron looks particularly snake-like, with more of an S-shape in flight. The call is a loud croaking "krek".</p>
<p>The purple heron is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
