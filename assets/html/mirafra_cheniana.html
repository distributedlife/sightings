<p>The <b>melodious lark</b> or <b>Latakoo lark</b> (<i>Mirafra cheniana</i>) is a species of <span>lark</span> in the <span>Alaudidae</span> family, that is currently threatened by <span>habitat loss</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_population">Range and population</span></h2>
<p>The species as a whole has, perhaps, a maximum <span>range</span> of 110,400 square kilometres (42,600&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi), but this is something of a tattered web; small, isolated communities are strewn primarily about parts of <span>South Africa</span> (<span>Eastern Cape</span>, and the <span>Free State</span>), with fewer still in <span>Botswana</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span>, and have limited opportunities for social interaction with each other.</p>
<p><span>Gauteng</span>, <span>KwaZulu-Natal</span>, <span>Limpopo</span>, and <span>North West Province</span> also have patches in <i>Mirafra cheniana's</i> fragmented range.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the natural <span>habitat</span> of <i>M. cheniana</i> is subtropical or tropical, seasonally wet or flooded, lowland <span>grassland</span>.</p>
<p>Within these regions, however, <i>M. cheniana</i> prefers life on the dryer slopes, such as there are, especially in open runs between grassy <span>tussocks</span>. It tends to avoid lower areas where <span>vegetation</span> grows taller and more densely, and <span>precipitation</span> collects, making it moister.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding_and_nesting">Breeding and nesting</span></h3>
<p><i>M. cheniana</i> is probably <span>territorial</span> and <span>monogamous</span>, and lays a clutch of 2-4 eggs.</p>
<p>It is generally resident, <span>breeding</span> throughout the months of September through March. The level of breeding activity varies somewhat depending on locality; in South Africa, the most active period is November through January, while in Zimbabwe it is January through March.</p>
<p>Otherwise, however, local communities are compelled to abandon one area for another when regular dry-season fires occur, though on any given year this may affect certain colonies while missing others.</p>
<p><i>M. cheniana</i> select different textures of <span>grass</span> or grass parts to build their domed, obliquely-accessed <span>nests</span>. They use the harder, and more fibrous grasses and stalks for an outer thatch, while the finer and softer grasses or grass leaves are used to line the nest's interior.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p><i>M. cheniana</i> <span>forages</span> on the land, eating mostly grass <span>seeds</span>, supplemented somewhat with <span>insects</span>.</p>
