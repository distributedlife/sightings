<p>The <b>banded mongoose</b> (<i>Mungos mungo</i>) is a <span>mongoose</span> commonly found in the central and eastern parts of <span>Africa</span>. It lives in <span>savannas</span>, open forests and <span>grasslands</span> and feeds primarily on <span>beetles</span> and <span>millipedes</span>. Mongooses use various types of dens for shelter including <span>termite mounds</span>. While most mongoose species live solitary lives, the banded mongoose live in colonies with a complex social structure.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_characteristics">Physical characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The banded mongoose is a sturdy mongoose with a large head, small ears, short, muscular limbs and a long tail, almost as long as the rest of the body. Animals of wetter areas are larger and darker colored than animals of dryer regions. The abdominal part of the body is higher and rounder than the breast area. The rough fur is grayish brown, and there are several dark brown to black horizontal bars across the back. The limbs and snout are darker, while the underparts are lighter than the rest of the body. Banded mongooses have long strong claws that allow them to dig in the soil.</p>
<p>An adult animal can reach a length of 30 to 45&#xA0;cm and a weight of 1.5 to 2.25&#xA0;kg. The tail is 15 to 30&#xA0;cm long.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_ecology">Range and ecology</span></h2>
<p>The banded mongoose is found in a large part of <span>East</span>, Southeast and South-Central Africa. There are also populations in the northern savannas of <span>West Africa</span>. The banded mongoose lives in <span>savannas</span>, open forests and <span>grassland</span>, especially near water, but also in dry, thorny <span>bushland</span> but not deserts. The species uses various types of dens for shelter, most commonly <span>termite mounds</span>. They will also live in rock shelters, thickets, gullies, and warrens under bushes. Mongooses prefer multi-entranced termitaria with open thicket, averaging 4 m from the nearest shelter, located in semi-closed woodland. In contrast to the den of the <span>dwarf mongoose</span>, banded mongoose dens are less dependent on vegetation cover and have more entrances. Banded mongooses live in larger groups than dwarf mongooses and this more entrances means more members have access to the den and ventilation. The development of <span>agriculture</span> in the continent has had a positive influence on the number of banded mongooses. The crops of the farmland serve as an extra food source.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_and_foraging">Food and foraging</span></h3>
<p>Banded mongoose feed primarily on insects, myriapods, small reptiles, and birds. <span>Millipedes</span> and <span>beetles</span> made of most of their diet, but they also commonly eat ants, crickets, termites, grasshoppers, caterpillars and earwigs. Other prey items of the mongoose includes <span>frogs</span>, <span>lizards</span>, small <span>snakes</span>, ground bird and the eggs of both birds and reptiles. On some occasions, mongooses will drink water from rain pools and lake shores.</p>
<p>Banded mongoose forage in groups but each member searches for food alone. They forage in the morning for several hours and then rest in the shade. They will usually forage again in the late afternoon. Mongooses use their sense of smell to locate their prey and dig them out with their long claws, both in holes in the ground and holes in trees. Mongoose will also frequent near the dung of large herbivores since they attract beetles. Low grunts are produced every few seconds for communication. Mongoose also feed individually and are not cooperative feeders. When hunting prey that secrete toxins, mongooses will roll them on the ground. Durable prey is thrown on hard surfaces.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Begging">Begging</span></h4>
<p>Banded mongoose females give birth in synchrony, producing large communal litters which remain in dens for 3&#x2013;4 weeks. When pups emerge from the den, they spend 3&#x2013;5 days approaching different helpers, after which individual pups form stable associations with a single adult helper (their &#x2018;&#x2018;escort&#x2019;&#x2019;) and remain associated with that animal until independence (approximately 9&#x2013;13 weeks). During a foraging session, pups follow escorts closely (usually within 10 cm), begging constantly with a high-pitched, bird-like chirp (average call rate = 34.4 calls/min). Packs forage as a cohesive unit, concentrated within 15&#x2013;20 m, so all escorts are exposed to begging by the whole litter. Pups receive their food almost exclusively from their escorts. Switching between escorts is rare and lasts for only a single day before returning to the original escort. Escorts do not feed pups associated with another adult.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_behaviour">Social behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Banded mongooses live in mixed-sex groups of 7&#x2013;40 individuals (average around 20). Groups sleep together at night in underground dens, often abandoned termite mounds, and change dens frequently (every 2&#x2013;3 days). When no refuge is available and hard-pressed by predators such as <span>wild dogs</span>, the group will form a compact arrangement in which they lie on each other with heads facing outwards and upwards.</p>

<p>There is generally no strict hierarchy in mongoose groups and aggression is low. Sometimes, mongoose may squabble over a food. However, typically, the one who claims the food first wins. Most aggression and hierarchical behavior occurs between males when females are in oestrus. Female are usually not aggressive but do live in hierarchies based on age. The older females have earlier estrous periods and have larger litters. When groups get too large, some females are forced out of the group by either older females or males. These females may form new groups with subordinate males.</p>

<p>Relations between groups are highly aggressive and mongooses are sometimes killed and injured during intergroup encounters. Nevertheless, breeding females will often mate with males from a rival groups during fights. Mongooses establish their territories with scent markings that may also serve as communication between those in the same group. In the society of the banded mongoose there is a clear separation between mating rivals and territorial rivals. Individuals within groups are rivals for mates while those from neighboring groups are competitors for food and resources.</p>

<p>Unlike most other social mongoose species, all females in a banded mongoose group can breed. They all enter oestrus around 10 days after giving birth, and are guarded and mated by 1&#x2013;3 dominant males. The dominant males monitor the females and aggressively defend them from subordinates. While these males do most of the mating, the females often try to escape from them and mate with other males in the group. A dominant male will spend 2&#x2013;3 days guarding each female. A guarding male will snap at, lunge at or pounce on any males that come near. A non-guarding male may follow a guarding male and his female and may face this aggression. Non-guarding males mate in a more secretive way. This kind of "sneaking" behavior is similar to what subordinate males of the fish species <span>Neolamprologus pulcher</span> do; they also try to mate with females that are guarded by the dominant males.</p>
<p>Gestation is 60&#x2013;70 days. In most breeding attempts, all females give birth either on the same day or within a few days. Litters range 2&#x2013;6 pups and average 4. For their first four weeks of life, pups stay in the dens. At this time they are guarded at the den by 1&#x2013;3 babysitters while the other group member go on their foraging trips. After four weeks, the pups are able to go foraging themselves. Each pup is cared for by a single adult "escort" who helps the pup to find food and protects it from danger. Pups become nutritionally independent at three months of age.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interspecies_relations">Interspecies relations</span></h3>
<p>In some locations (e.g., Kenya) banded mongooses have been found in close relationship with baboons. They forage together and probably enjoy greater security as a large group because of more eyes on the lookout for predators. The mongooses are handled by baboons of all ages and show no fear of such contact.</p>
<p>Banded mongooses have been observed removing ticks and other parasites from warthogs in Kenya and Uganda. The mongooses get food, while the warthogs get cleaned.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_abundance">Status and abundance</span></h2>
<p>Banded mongooses lives in many of Africa's protected areas. The <span>Serengeti</span> of Tanzania, has a density of around 3 mongooses per km. In southern <span>KwaZulu-Natal</span>, South Africa, mongoose numbers are at a similar density at 2.4&#xA0;km. <span>Queen Elizabeth National Park</span> has much higher mongoose densities at 18/km . Overall the banded mongoose tends to be more abundant in the eastern and south-eastern areas of its range than in more western areas.</p>
