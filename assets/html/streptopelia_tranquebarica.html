<p>The <b>red turtle dove</b> (<i>Streptopelia tranquebarica</i>), also known as the <b>red collared dove</b>, is a small <span>pigeon</span> which is a resident breeding bird in the tropics in the <span>Indian subcontinent</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat.2C_distribution_and_status">Habitat, distribution and status</span></h2>
<p>This dove is essentially a plains species, extending to <span>Taiwan</span> and the <span>Philippines</span> but uncommon on the Malaysian archipelago, avoiding rocky foothill and an oriential species. There is however a summer migration into the broader cultivated valleys of <span>Afghania</span> where it breeds. It is the commonest dove throughout <span>Punjab</span>. It is a summer migrant visitor to <span>India</span>, where it is more or less resident. They prefer better-wooded tracts such as canal or roadside tree plantations and avoid extensive desert regions. When they first arrive they are often in small flocks, but they soon split up and start pair formation and breeding.</p>
