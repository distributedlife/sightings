<p>The <b>green barbet</b> (<i>Stactolaema olivacea</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Lybiidae</span> family (African barbets). It is found in <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span> and <span>South Africa</span>. It occurs in forests from sea-level to 1,800 metres (5,900&#xA0;ft). Its isolated populations are vulnerable to forest clearing.</p>

<p>They have dull ginger-olive plumage, but are yellower on the wings, and paler below. The head and chin are dark brown in the nominate race, and the eyes vary from dull red to orange. The bill is black and the feet blackish. Juveniles are duller, with brown eyes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Call">Call</span></h2>
<p>Their call is a repetitive <i>chock, chock, ...</i>, or <i>chop, chop, ...</i>, sometimes in a duet.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits">Habits</span></h2>
<p>They frequent fruiting branches in the subcanopy, and vary from solitary to social during foraging and roosting. It is a sedentary species which is not known to undertake any movements. It may be particularly dependent on the fruit of wild figs. It breeds in cavities in tree trunks during mid summer.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The number of races (or species) is not generally agreed upon, and the conservation status of the taxa depend critically on their taxonomic evaluation. Race <i>S. o. hylophona</i> is sometimes merged with <i>woodwardi</i> in a taxon with tentative species status, the so-called Woodward's barbet. These birds have the ear coverts and hind brow marked in yellow, as opposed to the dusky-headed populations. The type was obtained from <span>oNgoye Forest</span> in South Africa, and named for its discoverers, the <span>Woodward brothers</span>. <i>S. o. belcheri</i>, which lacks the yellow ear coverts, is endemic to two isolated <span>inselbergs</span>, and may constitute a third species.</p>
