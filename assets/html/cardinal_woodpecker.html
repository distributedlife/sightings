<p>The <b>Cardinal Woodpecker</b> (<i>Dendropicos fuscescens</i>) is a widespread and common resident breeder in much of sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>. It is a species found in a wide range of habitats from dense forest to thornbush. It nests in a tree hole, unlined apart from wood chippings.</p>

<p>Like other <span>woodpeckers</span>, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or &#x201C;yoked" feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture <span>insects</span>.</p>
<p>This bird is 14&#x2013;15&#xA0;cm in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape, and has a dull olive back, marked with white spots. The underparts are white, heavily streaked with black, and the rump is tawny. The white throat and face are separated by a conspicuous black malar stripe, and the forecrown is brown. As with other woodpeckers, the head pattern varies with age and sex. The male has a red hind crown and nape, the female has a dark hindcrown and black nape, and juvenile males have a red hindcrown and black nape. The small <span>crest</span> is raised when the bird is excited.</p>
<p>The West African subspecies is distinctive. It has streaking on the face and chin, a yellow-buff ground colour to the underparts, and greener upperparts (except the juvenile), with weaker, yellower spotting.</p>
<p>Like other woodpeckers, this species is an <span>insectivore</span>. It is frequently seen, and regularly drums softly. The call is a high-pitched <i>krrrek-krrrek-krrrek</i>.</p>
