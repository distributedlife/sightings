<p><b>Schlieffen's bat</b> or <b>Schlieffen's twilight bat</b> (<i>Nycticeinops schlieffeni</i>) is a species of <span>vesper bat</span> found in <span>Africa</span>. It has been placed in numerous <span>genera</span> since its first description in 1859, but morphological and genetic studies have confirmed it as the <span>only species</span> in the genus <i><b>Nycticeinops</b></i>. It is named for the collector of the original specimen, <span>Wilhelm von Schlieffen-Schlieffiennburg</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Schlieffen's bat is an unusually small bat, measuring 4 to 5 centimetres (1.6 to 2.0&#xA0;in) in head-body length, and weighing only 3.7 to 5 grams (0.13 to 0.18&#xA0;oz). Although there is some variation on coat colour across its range, in general, the bat is brown with pale grey or white underparts. It has a broad, flattened skull, with a short, wide, sparsely haired snout. The ears are rounded, with a blunt, convex, <span>tragus</span>. There is a prominent <span>calcar</span> extending about half the way along the <span>uropatagial</span> border, and a proportionately long tail of approximately 3 centimetres (1.2&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>In many respects, Schlieffen's bats resemble the more familiar <span>evening bats</span> of North America; they can most readily be distinguished by the shorter snout, and by the detailed shape of the <span>baculum</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_subspecies">Distribution and subspecies</span></h2>
<p>Schlieffen's bat is found widely across Africa outside the equatorial rainforest. It inhabits a broad band of territory from <span>Mauritania</span> and <span>Senegal</span> in the west across to <span>Namibia</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Angola</span> and <span>Mozambique</span> in <span>Southern Africa</span>, to <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> in the <span>African Great Lakes</span> region, to <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Djibouti</span> and <span>Eritrea</span> in the <span>Horn of Africa</span>, to <span>Sudan</span> and <span>Egypt</span> in the <span>Nile Valley</span>. It is also found in the south-western <span>Arabian peninsula</span>.</p>
<p>Several subspecies of Schlieffen's bat have been identified. However, there has been little agreement on their status or range. The most recent analysis, as reported in the 2005 edition of <i><span>Mammal Species of the World</span></i>, concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the retention of any of these subspecies, and Schlieffen's bat should therefore be considered monotypic.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour_and_biology">Behaviour and biology</span></h2>
<p>Schlieffen's bats forage over fresh water, such as marshes, rivers, and lakes, and are found in a wide range of <span>riparian forest</span> and <span>savannah</span> environments. Like many bats, they are nocturnal, and they spend the day roosting in crevices in rocks and trees, and may take up residence in man-made buildings or cellars. They appear to be generally solitary, but may roost in small groups of three or so individuals.</p>
<p>The <span>echolocation</span> calls of Schlieffen's bats have been reported to be narrow band with steep <span>frequency modulation</span>, and to range from 39 to 47&#xA0;kHz. They feed primarily on <span>beetles</span> and <span>caddisflies</span>, and a smaller proportion of <span>moths</span>, <span>bugs</span>, and <span>flies</span>. Their predators are known to include <span>bat hawks</span>.</p>
<p>Schlieffen's bats mate in June, but carry the sperm in their uterus until August, when ovulation and fertilisation occur. They typically give birth to a litter of three young.</p>
