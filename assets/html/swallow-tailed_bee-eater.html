<p>The <b>Swallow-tailed Bee-eater</b> (<i>Merops hirundineus</i>) is a <span>near passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>bee-eater</span> <span>family</span> <i>Meropidae</i>. It breeds in savannah woodlands of sub-Saharan <span>Africa</span>. It is partially <span>migratory</span>, moving in response to rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. Its colours and readily visible forked tail make this species unmistakable. It is mainly green with a yellow throat, blue gorget and black eye stripe and beak. It can reach a length of 20&#x2013;22&#xA0;cm, including the long forked green or blue feathers. Sexes are alike.</p>
<p>This is a species which prefers somewhat more wooded country than most bee-eaters. This attractive bird is readily approached. Just as the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat <span>insects</span>, especially <span>bees</span>, <span>wasps</span> and <span>hornets</span>, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. Swallowtail has a preference for honeybees.</p>
<p>These bee-eaters are nesting as pairs or in very small <span>colonies</span> in sandy banks, or similar flat ground. They make a relatively long tunnel in which the 2 to 4 spherical, white eggs are laid. These birds also feed and roost communally.</p>
