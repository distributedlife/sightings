<p>The <b>Knysna Turaco</b> (<i>Tauraco corythaix</i>), or, in <span>South Africa</span>, <b>Knysna Lourie</b>, is a large <span>turaco</span>, one of a group of <span>African</span> <span>near-passerine</span> <span>birds</span>. It is a resident breeder in the mature evergreen forests of southern and eastern South Africa, and <span>Swaziland</span>. It was formerly sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the <span>Green Turaco</span> of West Africa. The <span>Livingstone's</span> and <span>Schalow's Turacos</span> were once considered <span>subspecies</span>.</p>
<p>This species lays two <span>eggs</span> in a shallow platform nest made from sticks and placed in a tree or clump of creepers.</p>
<p>Within its range, this is an unmistakable bird, although often inconspicuous in the treetops. It is 40&#x2013;42&#xA0;cm long, including a long tail. The small but thick orange-red bill and a white line just under the eye contrast with the mainly green <span>plumage</span>. It has a tall green crest, which is tipped with white. The eye is brown and the eye-ring deep red. In flight, Knysna Turaco shows conspicuous crimson primary flight feathers. Sexes are similar, but juvenile birds have a shorter crest without the white tips.</p>
<p>The Knysna Turaco is usually seen flying between forest trees, or hopping along branches. It feeds on fruit, insects and earthworms. It has a loud <i>kow-kow-kow-kow</i> call.</p>
