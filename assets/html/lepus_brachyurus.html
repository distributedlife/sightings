<p>The <b>Japanese hare</b> (<i>Lepus brachyurus</i>) is found across <span>Honshu</span>, <span>Shikoku</span>, and <span>Kyushu</span>, that is, all the main islands of Japan except <span>Hokkaido</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Japanese hare is mostly found in mountains or hilly areas in the places they inhabit. These are the areas that it prefers to live in. It also inhabits <span>forests</span> or brushy areas. Due to human encroachment though, this hare has thrived in and around urban environments, so much so that it has become a nuisance in some places.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_description">Physical description</span></h2>
<p>The Japanese hare is reddish-brown, with a body length that ranges from 45 to 54 centimetres (18 to 21&#xA0;in), and a body weight of 1.3 to 2.5 kilograms (2.9 to 5.5&#xA0;lb). Its tail will grow to lengths of 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 1.97&#xA0;in). Its front legs can be from 10 to 15 centimetres (3.9 to 5.9&#xA0;in) long and the back legs from 12 to 15 centimetres (4.7 to 5.9&#xA0;in) long. The ears grow to be 6 to 8 centimetres (2.4 to 3.1&#xA0;in) long, and the tail 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 1.97&#xA0;in) long. In areas of northern Japan, the west coast, and the island of Sado, where there is heavy snowfall, the Japanese hare loses its coloration in the autumn, remaining white until the spring, when the reddish-brown fur returns.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>The <span>litter</span> size of the Japanese hare varies from 1 to 6. The age of maturity is uncertain, but <span>females</span> probably breed within a year of birth. <span>Breeding</span> continues year round. Several litters are born each year, each of which contain 2&#x2013;4 individuals. <span>Mating</span> is promiscuous; males chase females, and box to repel rivals.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The Japanese hare, like most hares and rabbits, is <span>nocturnal</span> and feeds mainly in the evening and early morning. It is silent except when it is in distress and gives out a call for the distress. It can and will occupy burrows sometimes. It is a solitary animal except during mating season when males and females will gather for breeding.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Food">Food</span></h2>
<p>Vegetation found in and around its habitat is where the Japanese hare gets most of its nutrients. Grasses, shrubs, and bushes are all eaten by the hare. The Japanese hare is one of the few hares that will eat the bark off of trees and it does so occasionally which can cause major damage to trees and forests. They will sometimes eat the bark from a bonsai tree in Asia.</p>

<p>The Japanese hare populations seem to be stable. It is so stable in some places that it has become a nuisance animal in the regions that it inhabits. It is hunted in certain regions for food, fur, pelts, and to help curb its growing numbers in the places it lives in.</p>
<p>The mythic <span>Hare of Inaba</span> has a place in the <span>mythology of Japan</span> as an essential part of the legend of the <span>Shinto</span> god <span>&#x14C;kuninushi</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h2>
