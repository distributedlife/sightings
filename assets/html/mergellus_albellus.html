<p>The <b>smew</b> (<i>Mergellus albellus</i>) is a species of <span>duck</span>, and is the <span>only member</span> of the <span>genus</span> <i><b>Mergellus</b></i>. This genus is closely related to <i>Mergus</i> and is sometimes included in it, though it might be closer to the <span>goldeneyes</span> (<i>Bucephala</i>). The smew has interbred with the <span>common goldeneye</span> (<i>B. clangula</i>).</p>
<p>A seaduck fossil from the <span>Middle Miocene</span> shows that birds similar to smew existed up to 13&#xA0;<span>million years ago</span>. The extant species dates back to the <span>Pleistocene</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The drake smew, with its 'cracked ice' and 'panda' appearance, is unmistakable, and looks very black-and-white in flight. The females and immature males are grey birds with chestnut foreheads and crowns, and can be confused at a distance with the <span>Ruddy Duck</span>; they are often known as "redhead" smew. It has oval white wing-patches in flight. The smew's bill has a hooked tip and serrated edges, which help it catch fish when it dives for them.</p>
<p>The smew is 38&#x2013;44&#xA0;cm (15&#x2013;17&#xA0;in) long.</p>

<p>This species breeds in the northern <span>taiga</span> of <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>. It needs trees for breeding. The smew lives on fish-rich lakes and slow rivers. As a migrant it leaves its breeding areas and winters on sheltered coasts or inland lakes of the <span>Baltic Sea</span>, the <span>Black Sea</span>, northern Germany and the <span>Low Countries</span>, with a small number reaching <span>Great Britain</span> (for example, at <span>Dungeness</span>), mostly at regular sites. Vagrants have been recorded in North America. On lakes it prefers areas around the edges, often under small trees. The smew breeds in May and lays 6&#x2013;9 cream-colored eggs. It nests in tree holes, such as old <span>woodpecker</span> nests. It is a shy bird and flushes easily when disturbed.</p>
<p>The smew is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. It is not considered threatened on the <span>IUCN Red List</span>, though its population is decreasing.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fossil_history">Fossil history</span></h2>
<p>An unnamed <span>fossil</span> seaduck, known from a <span>humerus</span> found in the <span>Middle Miocene</span> <span>Saj&#xF3;v&#xF6;lgyi Formation</span> (Late <span>Badenian</span>, 13&#x2013;12 <span>million years ago</span>) of <span>M&#xE1;trasz&#xF5;l&#xF5;s</span>, <span>Hungary</span>, was assigned to <i>Mergus</i>. However, the authors included the smew therein, and consequently, the bone is more properly assigned to <i>Mergellus</i>&#x2014;especially as it was more similar to a smew's than to the <i>Bucephala</i> remains also found at the site. It is sometimes argued that the M&#xE1;trasz&#xF5;l&#xF5;s fossil is too old to represent any of the modern seaduck genera, but apparently these were all well-distinct even back then.</p>
<p>Fossils from the earliest <span>Pleistocene</span> found in England indicate that the living species was extant 1.5 to 2.0 million years ago.</p>
