<p>The <b>African black duck</b> (<i>Anas sparsa</i>) is a species of <span>duck</span> of the genus <i><span>Anas</span></i>. It is genetically closest to the <span>mallard</span> group, but shows some peculiarities in its behavior and (as far as they can be discerned) <span>plumage</span>; it is accordingly placed in the <span>subgenus</span> <i>Melananas</i> pending further research.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The African black duck is an entirely black duck with white marks on its back. It lives in central and southern <span>Africa</span>. It is also known as the black river duck, or (<i>A. s. leucostigma</i>) <span>West African</span> black duck or <span>Ethiopian</span> black duck. It is a medium-sized duck and is similar in size but when seen in pairs the male is noticeably bigger.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior_and_reproduction">Behavior and reproduction</span></h2>
<p>It is a very shy and territorial duck. It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks. It breeds throughout the year in different areas. <span>Incubation</span> is about 30 days by the mother and the fledgling period is 86 days and only the mother takes care of the young. Their <span>egg</span> quantity ranges from 4 to 8 eggs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>Though it likes to stay in <span>rivers</span> and <span>streams</span> during the day it prefers large open waters during the night. This duck likes water in the wooded hills of Africa and also like to hide its <span>nests</span> near running water. Also the African black duck makes its cup shaped nest of <span>driftwood</span> and matted <span>grass</span>. Though it builds its nest near running water it is always above flood level and on the ground.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>It is an <span>omnivore</span> that feeds off of <span>larvae</span> and <span>pupae</span> usually found under rocks, aquatic animals, <span>plant material</span>, <span>seeds</span>, small <span>fish</span>, <span>snails</span>, and <span>crabs</span>.</p>
