<p>The <b>lanceolated warbler</b> (<i>Locustella lanceolata</i>) is an Old World warbler in the <span>grass warbler</span> genus <i>Locustella</i>. It breeds from northeast European <span>Russia</span> across northern <span>Asia</span> to northern <span>Hokkaid&#x14D;</span>, <span>Japan</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in south east Asia.</p>
<p>This small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> is a species found in grassland with some thicker shrubby vegetation or trees, often close to water in bogs or wet clearings. Five eggs are laid in a nest in a tussock. This species is a rare <span>vagrant</span> to western <span>Europe</span>. One of the best places to see this <span>skulking</span> species as a vagrant is <span>Fair Isle</span>, <span>Shetland</span>.</p>
<p>This is a small warbler. The adult has a streaked brown back, whitish grey underparts, which have small lance-head like streaks, also found on the undertail. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous.</p>
<p>This is a skulky species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.</p>
<p>The song is a monotonous mechanical <span>insect</span>-like reeling as in other species in the group, often given at dusk.</p>
