<p>The <b>great shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus gravis</i>) is a large <span>shearwater</span> in the <span>seabird</span> family <span>Procellariidae</span>. Its relationships are unclear. It belongs in the group of large species that could be separated as genus <i>Ardenna</i> (Penhallurick &amp; Wink 2004); within these, it might be allied with the other black-billed, blunt-tailed species, the <span>short-tailed shearwater</span> and especially the <span>sooty shearwater</span> (Austin 1996, Heidrich <i>et al.</i> 1998). Alternatively (Austin 1996, Austin <i>et al.</i> 2004), it could be a <span>monotypic</span> subgenus (<i>Ardenna sensu stricto</i>), an Atlantic representative of the light-billed <i>Hemipuffinus</i> group (<span>pink-footed shearwater</span> and <span>flesh-footed shearwater</span>).</p>
<p>This species breeds on <span>Nightingale Island</span>, <span>Inaccessible Island</span>, <span>Tristan da Cunha</span>, and <span>Gough Island</span>. It is one of only a few <span>bird</span> species to <span>migrate</span> from breeding grounds in the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span> to the <span>Northern Hemisphere</span>, the normal pattern being the other way round. This shearwater nests in large colonies, laying one white egg in a small burrow or in the open grass. These nests are visited only at night to avoid predation by large <span>gulls</span>.</p>
<p>This shearwater, like the <span>sooty shearwater</span>, follows a circular route, moving up the eastern seaboard of first <span>South</span> and then <span>North America</span>, before crossing the <span>Atlantic</span> in August. It can be quite common off the south-western coasts of <span>Great Britain</span> and <span>Ireland</span> before heading back south again, this time down the eastern <span>littoral</span> of the Atlantic.</p>

In flight</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This bird has the typically "shearing" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. Its flight is powerful and direct, with wings held stiff and straight.</p>
<p>This shearwater is 43&#x2013;51&#xA0;cm in length with a 105&#x2013;122&#xA0;cm wingspan. It is identifiable by its size, dark upperparts, and underparts white except for a brown belly patch and dark shoulder markings. It has a black cap, black bill, and a white "horseshoe" on the base of the tail. The stiff flight, like a large <span>Manx shearwater</span>, is also distinctive. The only other large shearwater in its range is the all-dark sooty shearwater.</p>
<p>The great shearwater feeds on <span>fish</span> and <span>squid</span>, which it catches from the surface or by plunge-diving. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles. This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from ships or appropriate headlands. They have a piercing <i>eeyah</i> cry usually given when resting in groups on the water.</p>
