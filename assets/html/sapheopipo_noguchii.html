<p>The <b>Okinawa woodpecker</b> (<i>Sapheopipo noguchii</i>), <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x30CE;&#x30B0;&#x30C1;&#x30B2;&#x30E9;</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i>Noguchigera</i>)</span> is a <span>woodpecker</span> endemic to the island of <span>Okinawa</span> in <span>Japan</span>. It is the only member of the genus <i>Sapheopipo</i>.</p>
<p>Other <span>common names</span> for this species are Noguchi's woodpecker, Okinawan woodpecker, Pryer's woodpecker and Ryu Kyu woodpecker.</p>
<p>This is a medium-sized (31&#xA0;cm), dark woodpecker. It is dark brown in color with red-tipped <span>feathers</span>. It has white spots on the primaries. The head is a paler brown, with a dark red crown on the male and a blackish-brown one on the female. The call is a sharp whit call and a variable <i>kyu-kyu kup kup kup</i> or <i>kyu kyu kup</i>.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is subtropical, evergreen broad-leaved forest that is at least 30 years old, with tall trees of more than 20&#xA0;cm in diameter. Nesting is between late February and May.</p>
<p>This woodpecker is critically <span>endangered</span>. It has a single tiny, declining population which is threatened by habitat loss of mature forest due to <span>logging</span>, <span>dam</span> construction, <span>agriculture</span>, <span>military</span> and <span>golf course</span> developments. A major problem now is that one of their main habitats is being destroyed. The current population is estimated at less than 600. This species is suspected to be declining at a rate of 10-19% over ten years, as a result of ongoing clearance of old-growth forests.</p>
<p>This woodpecker is legally protected in Japan. It occurs in Yonaha-dake Prefecture Protection Area and small protected areas on <span>Mount Ibu</span> and Mount Nishime and conservation organisations have purchased sites where it occurs, but it is mainly found in the <span>Okinawa Prefecture</span>. In 1996, Yambaru was designated as a national park.</p>
