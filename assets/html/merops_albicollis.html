<p>The <b>White-throated Bee-eater</b> (<i>Merops albicollis</i>) is a <span>near passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>bee-eater</span> <span>family</span> Meropidae. It breeds in semi-desert along the southern edge of the <span>Sahara</span>, <span>Africa</span>. The White-throated Bee-eater is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in a completely different habitat in the equatorial rainforests of Africa from southern <span>Senegal</span> to <span>Uganda</span>.</p>
<p>This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly-coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green, but its face and throat are white with a black crown, eye stripe, and neckband. The underparts are pale green shading to blue on the breast. The eye is red and the beak is black.</p>
<p>The White-throated Bee-eater can reach a length of 19&#x2013;21&#xA0;cm, excluding the two very elongated central tail feathers, which can exceed an additional length of 12&#xA0;cm. They weigh between 20 and 28 grams. Sexes are alike. The call is similar to <span>European Bee-eater</span>.</p>
<p>The White-throated Bee-eater is a bird which breeds in dry sandy open country, such thorn scrub and near-desert. These abundant bee-eaters are gregarious, nesting <span>colonially</span> in sandy banks or open flat areas. They make a relatively long 1&#x2013;2 m tunnel in which the 6 to 7 spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs, but up to five helpers also assist with caring for the young.</p>
<p>White-throated Bee-eaters also feed and roost communally. As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat <span>insects</span>, especially <span>bees</span>, <span>wasps</span> and <span>hornets</span>, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. However, this species probably takes mainly flying <span>ants</span> and <span>beetles</span>.</p>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large range, the White-throated Bee-eater is evaluated as Least Concern on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species.</p>
