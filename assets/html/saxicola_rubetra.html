<p>The <b>whinchat</b> (<i>Saxicola rubetra</i>) is a small <span>migratory</span> <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> breeding in <span>Europe</span> and western <span>Asia</span> and wintering in <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Its <span>scientific name</span> means "small rock-dweller", in reference to its <span>habitat</span>. <i>Saxicola</i> derives from <span>Latin</span> <i>saxum</i> ("rock") + <i>incola</i> ("dwelling"); <i>rubetra</i> is a Latin term for a small bird.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>This species represents a fairly <span>basal</span> divergence of the genus <i><span>Saxicola</span></i>. It retains the supercilium found in many <span>Muscicapidae</span> but lost in the more derived <i>Saxicola</i> species such as the <span>European stonechat</span> or <span>African stonechat</span> (<i>S. torquatus</i>).</p>
<p>As with other species of <i>Saxicola</i>, it was formerly considered a member of the <span>thrush</span> family (Turdidae), but is now placed in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family Muscicapidae. It, and similar thrush-like Muscicapidae <span>species</span>, are often called <span>chats</span>.</p>
<p>Very rarely, <span>hybridisation</span> between whinchat and <span>Siberian stonechat</span> occurs, with a case in reported Finland in 1997.</p>

<p>The whinchat is similar in size to its relative the <span>European robin</span> (<i>Erithacus rubecula</i>), 12&#x2013;14&#xA0;cm long and 13&#x2013;26 g weight. Both sexes have brownish upperparts mottled darker, a buff throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish belly, and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers.</p>
<p>The male in breeding plumage has blackish face mask almost encircled by a strong white <span>supercilium</span> and <span>malar</span> stripe, a bright orange-buff throat and breast, and small white wing patches on the greater coverts and inner median coverts. The female is duller overall, in particular having browner face mask, pale buffy-brown breast, and a buff supercilium and malar stripe, and smaller or no white wing patches. Males in immature and winter plumage and are similar to females, except that adult males retain the white wing patches all year.</p>
<p>Though fairly similar to females and immatures of the <span>European stonechat</span> <i>S. rubicola</i>, the whinchat can readily be distinguished by its conspicuous supercilium and whiter belly, and also in western Europe, by being paler overall than the western European stonechat subspecies <i>S. rubicola hibernans</i>. It also differs structurally in being slightly slimmer and less 'dumpy', and having longer wingtips (an adaptation to its long-distance migration). It is more easily confused with female or immature <span>Siberian stonechat</span> <i>S. maura</i>, which (also being a long-distance migrant) shares the longer wingtips; however, Siberian stonechat can be distinguished by its conspicuous unmarked pale orange-buff rump (in whinchat, the rump is the same mottled brown colour as the back).</p>
<p>Its main call is a <i>hue-tac-tac</i>, the 'tac' softer and less grating than that of the European stonechat; the call is used both for contact between birds and predator alarms. The male has a whistling, crackly but soft song used during the breeding season, consisting of a mixture of soft whistles, tacs and more grating sounds; it is often mimetic, including phrases from the songs of at least 12 other assorted bird species. On the wintering grounds, it often gives alarm calls but only occasionally sings, particularly at the end of winter when starting spring migration.</p>

<p>The whinchat is a migratory species breeding in Europe and western Asia from <span>Ireland</span> and northern <span>Portugal</span> east to the <span>Ob River</span> basin near <span>Novosibirsk</span>, and from northern <span>Norway</span> south to central <span>Spain</span>, central <span>Italy</span>, northern <span>Greece</span>, and the <span>Caucasus Mountains</span>.</p>
<p>Birds arrive on the breeding grounds between the end of April and mid May, and depart between mid August and mid September (odd birds lingering to October). They winter primarily in tropical <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> from <span>Senegal</span> east to <span>Kenya</span> and south to <span>Zambia</span>, arriving in western Africa at the start of the <span>dry season</span> in late September to November, and leaving between February and March. Small numbers also winter in northwestern Africa in <span>Morocco</span>, northern <span>Algeria</span> and <span>Tunisia</span>.</p>

<p>The whinchat favours rough low vegetation habitats such as open rough pasture or similar minimally cultivated <span>grassland</span> with scattered small shrubs such as <span>Hawthorn</span> (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>), and <span>bracken</span> (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) or <span>Heather</span> (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) stands on rock-strewn ground. They also commonly use new and clear-felled conifer <span>plantations</span> until the new tree crop is about 5&#x2013;6 years old and a metre or two tall. It always needs at least a few perching points (shrubs, tall weeds, or fenceposts) to scan from for food and use as songposts. It nests in dense low vegetation, laying from four to seven eggs, which hatch after 11&#x2013;14 days. The young leave the nest on foot 10&#x2013;14 days after hatching, while still too young to fly; they then fledge at 17&#x2013;19 days after hatching and remain largely dependent on the parents for up to a further two weeks after fledging. Whinchats are short-lived, typically only surviving two years, to a maximum recorded of just over five years; breeding starts when birds are a year old. Predators include <span>weasels</span>, <span>stoats</span>, and small <span>raptors</span> such as the <span>merlin</span> and nest predators such as <span>crows and magpies</span>. Nests are also lost due to agricultural operations such as <span>silage</span> cutting (the main factor in the species' decline in western Europe) or trampling by livestock, and are sometimes parasitised by <span>cuckoos</span>.</p>
<p>Whinchats are <span>insectivorous</span>, feeding largely (about 80-90%) on <span>insects</span>, but also a wide range of other invertebrates including <span>spiders</span>, small <span>snails</span> and <span>worms</span>. It also eats small amounts of <span>fruit</span> such as <span>blackberries</span>, primarily in autumn. The birds like to perch on elevated spots such as shrubs, from where they make sallies to catch insects, mostly taken off the ground, but also flying insects. While so perched, males in particular frequently flick their tail and sometimes their wings to show the white tail and wing flashes, for display or territorial communication signals to other whinchats.</p>
<p>Adult whinchats have a single complex complete <span>moult</span> in late summer (late July onward) after breeding and mainly completed before southbound migration. Juveniles have a partial moult at the same time, growing new body feathering but retaining the flight feathers. All ages also have a partial moult in early spring on the wintering grounds before northbound migration.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>Fairly common across its wide range, the whinchat is classified as a species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. Some populations are however in serious decline, particularly in the west of its range in <span>Britain</span>, <span>Ireland</span>, <span>France</span>, <span>Belgium</span>, the <span>Netherlands</span>, <span>Denmark</span>, and <span>Germany</span>, primarily due to <span>agricultural intensification</span>. In Britain it is amber-listed with an unfavourable conservation status; it all but disappeared from former lowland breeding areas in the south and east between surveys in 1968-72 and 1988&#x2013;91, remaining common only in upland areas of the north and west where low-intensity <span>livestock</span> rearing is the main land use. There has been a similar decline in <span>Ireland</span>.</p>
<p>Vagrants have reached northwest of the breeding range to <span>Iceland</span>, west on migration to the <span>Canary Islands</span> and <span>Cape Verde</span>, and south of the wintering range to northern <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
