<p>The <b>common chaffinch</b> (<i>Fringilla coelebs</i>), usually known simply as the <b>chaffinch</b>, is a common and widespread small <span>passerine</span> bird in the <span>finch</span> family. The male is brightly coloured with a <span>blue-grey</span> cap and <span>rust-red</span> underparts. The female is much duller in colouring but both sexes have two contrasting white wings-bars and white sides to the tail. The male bird has a strong voice and sings from exposed perches to attract a mate.</p>
<p>The chaffinch breeds in much of Europe, across Asia to Siberia and in northwest Africa. It prefers open woodland and often forages on the ground. The female builds a nest with a deep cup in the fork of a tree. The <span>clutch</span> is typically 4&#x2013;5 eggs, which hatch in about 13&#xA0;days. The chicks <span>fledge</span> in around 14&#xA0;days but are fed by both adults for several weeks after leaving the nest. The chaffinch is a partial <span>migrant</span>; birds breeding in warmer regions are sedentary while those breeding in the colder northern areas of its range winter further south.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The chaffinch was described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in 1758 in the <span>10th edition</span> of his <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i> under its current <span>binomial name</span>. <i>Fringilla</i> is the Latin word for a finch while <i>coelebs</i> means unmarried or single. Linnaeus remarked that during the Swedish winter, only the female birds migrated south through Belgium to Italy. The English name comes from the <span>Old English</span> <i>ceaffinc</i>, where <i>ceaf</i> is "<span>chaff</span>" and <i>finc</i> "<span>finch</span>".</p>
<p>The finch family, <span>Fringillidae</span>, is divided into two subfamilies, the <span>Carduelinae</span>, containing around 28 <span>genera</span> with 141 <span>species</span> and the <span>Fringillinae</span> containing a single genus, <i><span>Fringilla</span></i>, with 3 species: the chaffinch (<i>Fringilla coelebs</i>), the <span>blue chaffinch</span> (<i>Fringilla teydea</i>), and the <span>brambling</span> (<i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>). The finch family are all seed-eaters with stout conical bills. They have similar skull morphologies, nine large <span>primaries</span>, twelve tail feathers and no <span>crop</span>. In all species the female bird builds the nest, incubates the eggs and broods the young. Fringilline finches raise their young almost entirely on <span>anthropods</span> while the cardueline finches raise their young on regurgitated seeds.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>A number of <span>subspecies</span> of the chaffinch have been described based principally on the differences in the pattern and colour of the adult male plumage. The list of subspecies can be divided into three groups: the "<i>coelebs</i> group" that occurs in Europe and Asia, the "<i>spondiogenys</i> group" in North Africa and the "<i>canariensis</i> group" on the <span>Canary Islands</span>. The subspecies from <span>Madeira</span> and the <span>Azores</span> are placed either in the "<i>canariensis</i> group" or in the "<i>spondiogenys</i> group". Genetic studies indicate that members of the "<i>coelebs</i> group" and the "<i>spondiogenys</i> group" are more closely related to each other than they are to members of the "<i>canariensis</i> group".</p>
<p>Within the "<i>spondiogenys</i> group" the gradual <span>clinal</span> variation over the large geographic range and the extensive <span>intergradation</span> means that the geographical limits and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities. The <span>International Ornithologists' Union</span> lists eleven subspecies from this group, whereas Collar et al. (2010) in the <span>Handbook of Birds of the World</span> list seven and consider the features of the subspecies <i>balearica</i> (<span>Mallorca</span>), <i>caucasica</i> (southern <span>Caucasus</span>), <i>schiebeli</i> (southern Greece, <span>Crete</span> and western Turkey), and <i>tyrrhenica</i> (<span>Corsica</span>) to fall within the variation of the <span>nominate subspecies</span>. They also suggest that the subspecies <i>alexandrovi</i>, <i>sarda</i>, <i>solomkoi</i>, and <i>syriaca</i> may represent variations of the nominate subspecies.</p>
<p>Su&#xE1;rez et al. (2009) used <span>mitochondrial</span> and <span>nuclear DNA</span> <span>markers</span> in a study of the three subspecies of <i>Fringilla coelebs</i> that are currently recognised on the Canary Islands. The authors concluded that the common chaffinches on the islands are sufficiently distinct in both <span>genotype</span> and <span>phenotype</span> to be considered as a separate species within the <i>Fringilla</i> genus. They also proposed a revised distribution of subspecies on the islands in which the birds on <span>La Palma</span> (<i>palmae</i>) and <span>El Hierro</span> (<i>ombrioso</i>) are grouped together as a single subspecies while the current <i>canariensis</i> subspecies is split into two with one subspecies occurring only on <span>Gran Canaria</span> and the other on <span>La Gomera</span> and <span>Tenerife</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The chaffinch is about 14.5&#xA0;cm (5.7&#xA0;in) long, with a wingspan of 24.5&#x2013;28.5&#xA0;cm (9.6&#x2013;11.2&#xA0;in) and a weight of 18&#x2013;29&#xA0;g (0.63&#x2013;1.02&#xA0;oz). The adult male of the nominate subspecies has a black forehead and a <span>blue-grey</span> crown, nape and upper mantle. The rump is a light <span>olive-green</span>; the lower mantle and scapulars form a brown saddle. The side of head, throat and breast are a dull <span>rust-red</span> merging to a pale creamy-pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers are dark grey with a black shaft streak. The rest of the tail is black apart from the two outer feathers on each side which have white wedges. Each wing has a contrasting white panel on the <span>coverts</span> and a buff-white bar on the <span>secondaries</span> and inner primaries. The <span>flight feathers</span> are black with white on the basal portions of the vanes. The secondaries and inner primaries have pale yellow fringes on the outer web whereas the outer primaries have a white outer edge.</p>
<p>After the autumn <span>moult</span> the tips of the new feathers have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The ends of the feathers wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown <span>irises</span> and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the <span>bill</span> is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or <span>culmen</span>, but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip.</p>
<p>The adult female is much duller in appearance than the male. The head and most of upperparts are shades of grey-brown. The underparts are paler. The lower back and rump are a dull olive green. The wings and tail are similar to those of the male. The juvenile resembles the female.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h3>
<p>The powerful song is very well known, and its <i>fink</i> or <i>vink</i> sounding call gives the finch family its English name. Males typically sing two or three different song types, and there are regional dialects too.</p>
<p>The acquisition by the young chaffinch of its song was the subject of an influential study by British ethologist <span>William Thorpe</span>. Thorpe determined that if the chaffinch is not exposed to the adult male's song during a certain <span>critical period</span> after hatching, it will never properly learn the song. He also found that in adult chaffinches, castration eliminates song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The chaffinch breeds in wooded areas where the July <span>isotherm</span> is between 12 and 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C (54 and 86&#xA0;&#xB0;F). The breeding range includes northwest Africa, most of Europe and extends eastwards across <span>temperate</span> Asia to the <span>Angara River</span> and the southern end of <span>Lake Baikal</span> in <span>Siberia</span>. There are also a number of distinctive subspecies on the <span>Azores</span>, the <span>Canary Islands</span> and the <span>Madeira Islands</span> in the Atlantic Ocean. The chaffinch was introduced from Britain into several of its overseas territories in the 19th century. In New Zealand the chaffinch has colonised both the <span>North</span> and <span>South Islands</span> and is now one of the most common passerine species. In South Africa a very small breeding colony in the suburbs of <span>Constantia</span>, <span>Hout Bay</span> and <span>Camps Bay</span> near <span>Cape Town</span> is the only remnant of another such introduction.</p>

Eggs of <i>Fringilla coelebs moreletti</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This bird is not <span>migratory</span> in the milder parts of its range, but vacates the colder regions in winter. This species forms loose flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with <span>Bramblings</span>. This bird occasionally strays to eastern North America, although some sightings may be escapees.</p>
<p>The main food of the chaffinch is <span>seeds</span>, but unlike most finches, the young are fed extensively on <span>insects</span>, and adults also eat insects in the breeding season.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Chaffinches first breed when they are one year old. They are mainly monogamous and the pair-bond for residential subspecies such as <i>gengleri</i> sometimes persists from one year to the next. The date for breeding is dependent on the spring temperature and is earlier in southwest Europe and later in the northeast. In Britain most <span>clutches</span> are laid between late April and the middle of June. A male attracts a female to his territory through song.</p>
<p>Nests are built entirely by the female and are usually located in the fork of a bush or a tree several metres above the ground. The nest has a deep cup and is lined with a layer of thin roots and feathers. The outside is covered with a layer of lichen and spider silk over an inner layer of moss and grass. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals until the <span>clutch</span> is complete. The clutch is typically 4&#x2013;5 eggs which are smooth and slightly glossy but very variable in colour. They range from pale-blueish green to light red with purple brown blotches, spots or steaks. The average size of an egg is 19&#xA0;mm &#xD7;&#xA0;15&#xA0;mm (0.75&#xA0;in &#xD7;&#xA0;0.59&#xA0;in) with a weight of 2.2&#xA0;g (0.078&#xA0;oz). The eggs are incubated for 10&#x2013;16 days by the female. The chicks are <span>altricial</span>, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents but mainly by the female who broods them for around six days. They are mainly fed caterpillars. The nestlings fledge 11&#x2013;18 days after hatching and disperse. The young birds are then assisted with feeding by both parents for a further three weeks. The parents only very rarely start a second brood, but when they do so it is always in a new nest.</p>
<p>In a study carried out in Britain using <span>ring-recovery</span> data, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 53&#xA0;per cent, and the adult annual survival rate was 59&#xA0;per cent. From these figures the typical lifespan is only three years, but the maximum age recorded is 15 years and 6 months for a bird in Switzerland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Predators_and_parasites">Predators and parasites</span></h2>
<p>The eggs and nestlings of the chaffinch are predated by <span>crows</span>, <span>red</span> and <span>grey squirrels</span>, domestic cats and probably also by <span>stoats</span> and <span>weasels</span>. Clutches begun later in the spring suffer less predation, an effect that is believed to be due to the increased vegetation making nests more difficult to find.</p>
<p>The <span>protozoal</span> parasite <i><span>Trichomonas gallinae</span></i> was known to infect pigeons and raptors but beginning in Britain in 2005, carcases of dead <span>European greenfinches</span> and chaffinches were found to be infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008 infected carcases were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany. The spread of the disease is believed to have been mediated by chaffinches as large numbers of the birds breed in northern Europe and winter in Britain. In Britain the number of infected carcases recovered each year declined after a peak in 2006. There was a reduction in the number of greenfinches but no significant decline in the overall number of chaffinches. A similar pattern occurred in Finland where, after the arrival of the disease in 2008, there was a reduction in the number of greenfinches but only a small change in the number of chaffinches.</p>
<p>Chaffinches can develop tumors on their feet and legs caused by the <i>Fringilla coelebs</i> <span>papillomavirus</span>. The size of the <span>papillomas</span> range from a small nodule on a digit to a large growth involving both the foot and the leg. The disease is uncommon: in a 1973 study undertaken in the Netherlands, of around 25,000 chaffinches screened only 330 bore papillomas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The chaffinch has an extensive range, estimated at 7 million square kilometres (3.7 million square miles) and a large population including an estimated 130&#x2013;240 million breeding pairs in Europe. Allowing for the birds breeding in Asia, the total population lies between 530&#x2013;1,400 million individuals. There is no evidence of any serious overall decline in numbers, so the species is classified by the <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> as being of <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>endemic</span> subspecies on the <span>Macaronesian</span> islands in the Atlantic are vulnerable to the loss of habitat, especially <i>F. c. ombriosa</i> on <span>El Hierro</span> in the Canary Islands where the breeding population is between 1000-5000 pairs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_to_humans">Relationship to humans</span></h2>
<p>The chaffinch is a popular pet bird in some European countries. In Belgium, the ancient traditional sport of <span>vinkenzetting</span> pits male chaffinches against one another in a contest for the most bird calls in an hour.</p>
<p><span>William Turner</span> described the chaffinch in his book on birds published in 1544. The book is in Latin but he gives two English folk names: <i>sheld-appel</i> and <i>spink</i>. The word <i>sheld</i> is a dialectal word meaning pied or multicoloured (as in <span>Shelduck</span>). Appel may be related to <i>Alp</i>, an obsolete word for a bullfinch. The name <i>spink</i> is probably derived from the bird's call note. The names <i>spink</i> and <i>shell apple</i> are among the many folk names listed for the chaffinch by Reverend Charles Swainson in his <i>Provincial Names and Folk Lore of British Birds</i> (1885).</p>
<p>The chaffinch is depicted in a marginal decoration of the 15th century English illuminated manuscript the <span>Sherborne Missal</span>.</p>
