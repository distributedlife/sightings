<p>The Diederik Cuckoo is a smallish cuckoo at 18 to 20&#xA0;cm. Adult males are glossy green above with copper-sheened areas on the back and whitish underparts. They have a broken white eye-stripe and a short, green <span>malar stripe</span>. All <span>remiges</span> have three to four white spots on the inner vanes. The four green outer tail <span>feathers</span> are tipped white, and the outermost pair are spotted white on both vanes.</p>
<p>Females show more copper above, and have coppery barring on the flanks. The underparts are often washed brownish.</p>
<p>Juveniles have a red bill, streaky throat and a white wing-bar. They are more copper-coloured above and browner below than the females, and the flank markings are brown blotches.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The Diederik Cuckoo is a brood parasite. It lays a single <span>egg</span> mostly in the nests of <span>weavers</span>, especially the <span>Village Weaver</span> and the bishops in the genus <i><span>Euplectes</span></i>. For example, it has been recorded in <span>Red-collared Widowbirds</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The Diederik Cuckoo takes a variety of insects and <span>caterpillars</span>. It is a noisy species, with the persistent and loud <i>deed-deed-deed-deed-er-ick</i> call from which it gets its name. Usually four clear, roughly identical, notes followed by a little twitter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is a common resident breeder in <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> which has been recorded as far north as Cyprus (1982). It is a short-distance seasonal <span>migrant</span>, moving with the rains. It is a solitary bird, found in open woodland, savanna and riverside bushes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The <span>genus</span> name <i>Chrysococcyx</i> is <span>Greek</span> for gold cuckoo (<i><span>&#x3C7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3CC;&#x3C2;</span></i>, <i><span>&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3CD;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span></i>) The specific name <i>caprius</i> is thought to be a misprint for either <i>cuprea</i> (<span>coppery</span>) or <i>capensis</i> (of <span>Cape of Good Hope</span>).</p>
