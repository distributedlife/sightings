<p>The <b>common quail</b> (<i>Coturnix coturnix</i>) is a small bird in the pheasant family <span>Phasianidae</span>. It is widespread and is found in parts of Europe; it should not be confused with the domesticated <span>Japanese quail</span>, <i>Coturnix japonica</i>, native to Asia which although visually similar have very distinct calls.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a small, round bird, essentially streaked brown with a white eyestripe, and, in the male, a white chin. As befits its migratory nature, it has long wings, unlike the typically short-winged gamebirds. It measures roughly 7.1&#x2013;8.62&#xA0;in (18.0&#x2013;21.9&#xA0;cm) and weighs 3.2&#x2013;4.62&#xA0;oz (91&#x2013;131&#xA0;g)</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits">Habits</span></h2>
<p>This is a terrestrial species, feeding on <span>seeds</span> and <span>insects</span> on the ground. It is notoriously difficult to see, keeping hidden in crops, and reluctant to fly, preferring to creep away instead. Even when flushed, it keeps low and soon drops back into cover. Often the only indication of its presence is the distinctive "wet-my-lips" repetitive song of the male. The call is uttered mostly in the mornings, evenings and sometimes at night. It is a strongly <span>migratory</span> <span>bird</span>, unlike most <span>game birds</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>Upon attaining an age of 6&#x2013;8 weeks, this <span>quail</span> breeds on open <span>arable farmland</span> and <span>grassland</span> across most of <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>, laying 6-12 <span>eggs</span> in a ground nest. The eggs take from 16&#x2013;18 days to hatch.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Races">Races</span></h2>
<p>This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Tetrao coturnix</i>. The Eurasian race, <i>C. c. coturnix</i>, overwinters southwards in Africa's <span>Sahel</span> and India. The populations on <span>Madeira</span> and the <span>Canary Islands</span> belong to the nominate race. The African race, <i>C. c. africana</i>, described by <span>Temminck</span> and <span>Schlegel</span>, in 1849, is known as the African quail. It overwinters within Africa, some moving northwards from South Africa. The common quails of <span>Madagascar</span> and the <span>Comoros</span> belong to the same African race, although those found around <span>Ethiopia</span> make up a different subspecies, the Abyssinian quail, <i>C. c. erlangeri</i> (Zedlitz, 1912). The fairly numerous population of the <span>Cape Verde</span> islands, belong to a separate race, <i>C. c. inopinata</i>, (described by <span>Hartert</span> in 1917), while those on the <span>Azores</span> belong to race <i>C. c. conturbans</i> (Hartert, 1917).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Utilization">Utilization</span></h2>
<p><span>Exodus 16:1-13</span> relates how the migrating Israelites asked God for meat and were provided with a massive flock of migrating quail. It is still heavily hunted as <span>game</span> on passage through the <span>Mediterranean</span> area. This species over recent years has seen an increase in its <span>propagation</span> in the <span>United States</span> and <span>Europe</span>. However, most of this increase is with <span>hobbyists</span>.</p>
<p>In 1537 Queen <span>Jane Seymour</span>, third wife of <span>Henry VIII</span>, pregnant with the future King <span>Edward VI</span>, developed an insatiable craving for quail, and courtiers and diplomats abroad were ordered to find sufficient supplies for the Queen.</p>
