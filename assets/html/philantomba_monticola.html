<p>The <b>blue duiker</b> (<i><b>Philantomba monticola</b></i>) is a small, forest-dwelling <span>duiker</span> found in the <span>Central Africa</span> and southern <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Blue duikers stand around 35&#xA0;cm (14&#xA0;in) tall at the shoulder and weigh 4&#xA0;kg (8.8&#xA0;lb).They are the smallest of the antelope family. The blue duiker has a brown coat with a slight blue tinge &#x2013; hence the name &#x2013; and a white underside. A glandular slit occurs beneath both eyes, with a very slight crest between the ears. There is an elongated, oval crown situated on the back of the neck between the shoulder line and the horns, about 2cm x 5cm. It has simple conical horns of 2 to 10&#xA0;cm (0.79 to 3.94&#xA0;in). Females do not always have horns, in both sexes horns may be poorly developed, less than 2cm long. The average lifespan is 10&#x2013;12 years.</p>
<p>Blue duikers live mainly in <span>rainforests</span>, where they eat <span>fruit</span>, <span>flowers</span>, and <span>leaves</span>, which have fallen from the <span>canopy</span>, as well as <span>eggs</span> and <span>insects</span>. They are, in turn, the prey of the <span>crowned eagle</span>. They are <span>nocturnal</span> and solitary or form mating pairs. Observations in the Western Cape (Wilderness) indicate blue duikers to be strictly diurnal and not active after dark. They are very <span>territorial</span> animals, patrolling the borders of their territory and <span>marking</span> them with their dung and excretions from glands above their hooves and under their eyes (<span>preorbital glands</span>). They will chase off any intruders and only tolerate their offspring's presence until they reach 18 months of age.</p>
<p>Blue duikers generally produce one offspring per year. Gestation is estimated at between 4 and 7.5 months. Observations in the Western Cape indicate that, under favorable conditions, a female produced a lamb about every eight months for five years. Lambs remain hidden for 56 days (eight weeks) and then make their appearance, about 20% smaller than adult size. A popular activity is to sprint at high speed through dense undergrowth, possibly to practice escape routes.</p>
<p>Blue duikers are not at all endangered and are in fact quite common; in <span>Gabon</span>, they can reach population densities of almost 80 animals per km.</p>
