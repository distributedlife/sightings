<p>The <b>Brown-headed Apalis</b> (<i>Apalis alticola</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Apalis</span></i> in the family <span>Cisticolidae</span>. It is sometimes included within the <span>Grey Apalis</span> (<i>A. cinerea</i>) but is now commonly considered to be a separate species. It has two <span>subspecies</span>: <i>A. a. alticola</i> and <i>A. a. dowsetti</i></p>
<p>It is 12&#x2013;13&#xA0;cm long with a long tail and fairly long, slender <span>bill</span>. The legs and feet are pinkish and the eye is pale orange. The upperparts are grey-brown, becoming chocolate-brown on the crown and cheeks. The underparts are whitish. The adult male and female are alike; <span>juvenile</span> birds are more olive above and slightly yellowish below. In <i>A. a. alticola</i>, the outer tail-feathers have white tips and outer webs and the next three pairs of tail-feathers have small white tips. <i>A. a. dowsetti</i> has entirely white outer tail-feathers.</p>
<p>The Grey Apalis is similar but has a grey-brown head and dark eye. The outer tail-feathers are white like those of <i>A. a. dowsetti</i> but it does not overlap in range with that subspecies.</p>
<p>The <span>song</span> of the Brown-headed Apalis is a series of loud, high-pitched "chip" notes.</p>
<p>It has a patchy distribution in central and east <span>Africa</span>. It inhabits <span>forest</span> and <span>secondary growth</span> at mid to high altitudes. It is often seen in pairs or small groups and frequently joins other bird species in <span>mixed-species feeding flocks</span>. <i>A. a. alticola</i> occurs in parts of <span>Angola</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, south-eastern <span>Democratic Republic of Congo</span>, <span>Tanzania</span> and the <span>Nguruman Escarpment</span> in southern <span>Kenya</span>. In locations where its range overlaps with the Grey Apalis, it is restricted to the forest edge. <i>A. a. dowsetti</i> is found only on the <span>Marungu plateau</span> in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
