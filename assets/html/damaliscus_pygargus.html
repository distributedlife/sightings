<p>The <b>bontebok</b> is an <span>antelope</span> found in <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Lesotho</span>. The bontebok has two <span>subspecies</span>; the endangered bontebok (<i>Damaliscus pygargus pygarus</i>), occurring naturally in the <span>Fynbos</span> and Renosterveld areas of the Western Cape, and the <span>blesbok</span> (<i>Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi</i>) occurring in the <span>highveld</span>.</p>

<p>The bontebok is a tall, medium-sized antelope. They typically stand 80 to 100&#xA0;cm (31 to 39&#xA0;in) high at the shoulder and measure 120 to 210&#xA0;cm (47 to 83&#xA0;in) along the head and body. The tail can range from 30 to 60&#xA0;cm (12 to 24&#xA0;in). Body mass can vary from 50 to 155&#xA0;kg (110 to 342&#xA0;lb). Males are slightly larger and noticeably heavier than females. The bontebok is a chocolate brown colour, with a white underside and a white stripe from the forehead to the tip of the nose, although there is a brown stripe across the white near the eyes in most blesbok. The bontebok also has a distinctive white patch around its tail (whence the Latin name), while this patch is light brown/tan in blesbok. The horns of bontebok are lyre-shaped and clearly ringed. They are found in both sexes and can reach a length of half a metre.</p>
<p>Blesbok live in highveld, where they eat short <span>grasses</span>, while bontebok are restricted to coastal Fynbos and Renosterveld. They are <span>diurnal</span>, though they rest during the heat of the day. Herds contain only males, only females, or are mixed, and do not exceed 40 animals for bonteboks or 70 for blesboks.</p>
<p>Bontebok are not good jumpers, but they are very good at crawling under things. Mature males form territories and face down other males in displays and occasionally combat.</p>
<p>Bontebok were once extensively killed as <span>pests</span>, and were reduced to a wild population of just 17 animals, but the species has since recovered. Blesbok are extinct in their natural <span>habitat</span>, but they have increased in population to the point where they are now very abundant and avidly <span>farmed</span>, because they are popular quarry for hunters and are easy to sustain.</p>
