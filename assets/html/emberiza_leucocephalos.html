<p>The <b>pine bunting</b> (<i>Emberiza leucocephalos</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>bunting</span> family Emberizidae, a group most modern authors now separate from the <span>finches</span>, Fringillidae.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding_and_habitat">Breeding and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The pine bunting breeds across much of temperate <span>Asia</span>, <span>migrating</span> south to central Asia, north <span>India</span> and southern <span>China</span> in winter. It is common in all sorts of open land with some scrub or trees, including cultivation, but has a greater preference for open forest (usually <span>pines</span>) than the closely related <span>yellowhammer</span>. It is a rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>, but often winters in north-east Italy and <span>Tuscany</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance_and_song">Appearance and song</span></h2>
<p>The pine bunting is a robust 16-17.5-centimetre bird, with a thick <span>seed</span>-eater's <span>bill</span>. The male has a white crown and cheeks, and a chestnut forehead and throat, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much duller and is more streaked on its undersides. Non-breeding <span>plumage</span> is like that of a yellowhammer, but with all the yellow replaced by white. Its song and calls are like those of the yellowhammer.</p>

<p>Hybrids between pine bunting and yellowhammer show a mixture of characters. One such bird, a <span>vagrant</span> in <span>Suffolk</span>, <span>England</span> in 1982, the "Sizewell bunting", is documented and illustrated with photographs in <i><span>British Birds</span></i> </p>
<p>Some doubt has been cast upon male birds which appear to all intents and purposes to be pure pine buntings, but show yellow primary fringes. Previously, in Britain, these were regarded as potentially hybrid birds, and not accepted by the <span>British Birds Rarities Committee</span>. However since 2004, BBRC has regarded these birds as acceptable if they also meet the following conditions:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>The pine bunting's natural food consists seeds, and when feeding young, insects. The nest is on the ground. Four to six <span>eggs</span> are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of buntings.</p>
