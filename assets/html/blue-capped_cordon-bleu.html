<p>The <b>blue-capped cordon-bleu</b> (<i>Uraeginthus cyanocephalus</i>) is native to <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Sudan</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> in <span>East Africa</span>. This small <span>finch</span> does fairly well in captivity given adequate conditions, however, breeding this finch is said to be quite difficult.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The blue-capped cordon-bleu inhabits subtropical or tropical (lowland) dry grassland, shrubland and desert. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 390,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feature">Feature</span></h2>
<p>The finch is an <span>omnivorous</span> <span>passerine</span>, eating seeds and small insects. Most of this species do not exceed 7.5&#xA0;cm (3 in.) in length and are quiet relative to other finches.</p>
<p>Blue-capped males (pictured at right) have blue on the tops of their heads and tend to be more vivid in color. On female blue-caps the light brown coloration on the wings extends to the nape of the neck and over the top the head.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
<p>Origin and <span>phylogeny</span> has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).</p>
