<p><i><b>Myosorex varius</b></i>, the <b>forest shrew</b>, is a species of <span>shrew</span> in the mouse shrew family, <span>Soricidae</span>. It is found in <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, and <span>Swaziland</span>. Its natural <span>habitats</span> include temperate <span>forests</span>, dry <span>savanna</span>, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, and temperate <span>grassland</span>. The term "forest shrews" in the plural is sometimes confusingly used to collectively refer to a different genus, <i><span>Sylvisorex</span></i>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The forest shrew grows to a length of about 12.5&#xA0;cm (5&#xA0;in) with a tail of 4.3&#xA0;cm (1.7&#xA0;in) and an average mass of about 12&#xA0;g (0.4&#xA0;oz). In <span>KwaZulu-Natal</span> and the <span>Drakensberg</span> region the males are larger than the females but in the <span>Cape Colony</span> the sexes are of similar sizes. This shrew is covered in short, dense fur, dark grey or brown above and paler underneath.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The forest shrew is native to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. In upland areas it is often the commonest small mammal but it is less common in coastal areas. It is found in a wide range of primary and secondary habitats including forests, grassland, scrub, semi-desert, <span>karoo</span> and <span>fynbos</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology">Biology</span></h2>
<p>The forest shrew excavates a shallow burrow or takes over the burrow of another small mammal. The complex of passages has several entrances and a nesting chamber containing dry grasses. These shrews are <span>territorial</span> and a breeding pair of shrews is often found in a nest.</p>
<p>The forest shrew is mainly nocturnal and is an <span>insectivore</span>, but its diet also includes any small invertebrates it can find including <span>earthworms</span>, <span>millipedes</span>, <span>centipedes</span>, <span>crustaceans</span> and <span>spiders</span>. The forest shrew is itself eaten by <span>barn owls</span>, <span>marsh mongooses</span>, <span>striped weasels</span> and <span>striped polecats</span>. To avoid predation it spends most of its time in its burrow and only leaves when it needs to feed or defecate. Its droppings are very pungent.</p>
<p>The breeding season varies across the forest shrew's range. In some areas breeding takes place all year round but in others it is correlated with the higher rainfall which occurs in the summer, while unusually wet weather at other times of year can spark further reproductive activity.</p>
<p>The forest shrew often contains the <span>brachylaimid</span> <span>trematode</span> <i><span>Renylaima capensis</span></i> in its kidney and ureter. This parasitic fluke has been found to have a three-host life cycle, the first intermediate host being the terrestrial slug <i><span>Ariostralis nebulosa</span></i> and the second, another slug <i><span>Ariopelta capensis</span></i>. The forest shrew feeds on both these slugs.</p>
<p>Feeding as it does on small invertebrates, the forest shrew tends to accumulate any <span>environmental contaminants</span> in its tissues. Earthworms are known to bioaccumulate <span>lead</span> and the levels of lead in forest shrews are found to rise when they eat contaminated earthworms. This enables the shrews to be used as <span>bioindicators</span> of heavy metal pollution.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The <span>IUCN</span> lists the forest shrew as being of "<span>Least Concern</span>". This is because it has a wide distribution and is common over much of its range and the population seems stable. It is able to adapt to variations in its habitat and no specific threats have been identified.</p>
