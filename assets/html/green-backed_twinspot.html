<p>The <b>Green-backed Twinspot</b> (<i>Mandingoa nitidula</i>) is an <span>estrildid finch</span> found in sub-saharan <span>Africa</span>. This species is evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h2>
<p>The Green-backed Twinspot has four sub-species:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Green-backed Twinspot inhabits lowland moist forests of the tropical region. It may also be found in grassland and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Sexes: Males distinguished from females by their bright red facial feathers. Females have an olive-green face and darker (almost black) beak.</p>
<p>Breeding: The green backed twinspot prefers its privacy in regards to breeding. Males in the breeding season will raise their heads, looking straight up while "dancing" on the perch next to the female, moving in a side-stepping fashion. The female, if receptive, will crouch down and point her tail to the male. Green backed twinspots tend to pair with one female and care for her and the young while breeding. Up to 4 eggs are laid approx 5 days after mating, usually 1 daily. The female will go in and out of the nest frequently until all eggs are laid and will sit in place to incubate thereafter, ensuring all hatch in relatively close proximity.</p>
<p>Housing: This species enjoys a large, planted aviary with plenty of privacy for breeding. Temperatures in captivity should not dip below 70F degrees or exceed 84F. Green back twinspots may be housed as single pairs, singles, or in groups up to 4 pairs in a large flight.</p>
<p>Diet: millet, dark leafy greens, fresh banana, cooked brown rice, mixed finch seed.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
<p>Origin and <span>phylogeny</span> has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).</p>
