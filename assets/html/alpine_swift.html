<p>The <b>Alpine swift</b> (<i>Tachymarptis melba</i>) or <i>Apus melba</i>, is a species of <span>swift</span>. Alpine swifts breed in mountains from southern <span>Europe</span> to the <span>Himalaya</span>. Like <span>common swifts</span>, they are strongly <span>migratory</span>, and winter much further south in southern <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Swifts have very short legs which are used for clinging to vertical surfaces. The scientific name comes from the <span>Ancient Greek</span> &#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;, <i>apous</i>, meaning "without feet". They never settle voluntarily on the ground, spending most of their lives in the air living on the insects they catch in their beaks. Alpine swift are able to stay aloft in the air for up to seven months at a time, even drinking water "on the wing". Their vital physiological processes, including sleep, can be performed while in continuous flight.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description_and_biology">Description and biology</span></h2>
<p>The bird is superficially similar to a large <span>barn swallow</span> or <span>house martin</span>. It is, however, completely unrelated to those <span>passerine</span> species, since swifts are in the order <span>Apodiformes</span>. The resemblances between the groups are due to <span>convergent evolution</span>, reflecting similar life styles.</p>

Like <span>common swifts</span>, they are strongly <span>migratory</span>, and winter much further south in southern <span>Africa</span>. They wander widely on migration, and are regularly seen in much of southern Europe and <span>Asia</span>. The species seems to have been much more widespread during the <span>last ice age</span>, with a large colony breeding, for example in the Late <span>Pleistocene</span> Cave No 16, <span>Bulgaria</span>, around 18,000&#x2013;40,000 years ago. The same situation has been found for Komarowa Cave near <span>Cz&#x119;stochowa</span>, <span>Poland</span> during a period about 20,000&#x2013;40,000 years ago.</p>

<p>These apodiformes build their nests in colonies in a suitable cliff hole or cave, laying 2&#x2013;3 eggs. Swifts will return to the same sites year after year, rebuilding their nests when necessary, and pairing for life. Young swifts in the nest can drop their body temperature and become torpid if bad weather prevents their parents from catching insects nearby. They have adapted well to urban conditions, frequently nesting in old buildings in towns around the Mediterranean, where large, low-flying flocks are a familiar feature in summer.</p>
<p>Alpine swifts are readily distinguished from the common swifts by their larger size and their white belly and throat. They are around twice as big as most other swifts in its range, about 20 to 23&#xA0;cm (7.9 to 9.1&#xA0;in) in length, with a wingspan of 57&#xA0;cm (22&#xA0;in) and a weight of around 100&#xA0;g (3.5&#xA0;oz). They're largely dark brown in colour, with white patches underneath the beak and on the breast that are separated by a dark brown streak. Juveniles are similar to adults, but their feathers are pale edged.</p>
<p>In comparison, the <span>common swift</span> has a wingspan of around 42&#xA0;cm (17&#xA0;in). A dark neck band separates the white throat from the white belly. They have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a <span>boomerang</span> but may (as in the image) be held stretched straight out. Their flight is slower and more powerful than that of their smaller relative, with a call that is a drawn-out twittering (listen at right).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Life_on_the_wing">Life on the wing</span></h2>
<p>Alpine swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing, but roost on vertical cliffs or walls. A study published in 2013 showed Alpine swifts can spend over six months flying without having to land. All vital physiological processes, including sleep, can be performed while on air.</p>
<p>In 2011, Felix Liechti and his colleagues at the <span>Swiss Ornithological Institute</span> attached electronic tags that log movement to six alpine swifts and it was discovered that the birds could stay aloft in the air for more than 200 days straight.</p>
