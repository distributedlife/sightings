<p>The <b>Hawaiian petrel</b> or <i><b><span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>Ua<span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>u</b></i> (<i>Pterodroma sandwichensis</i>) is a large, dark grey-brown and white <span>petrel</span> that is <span>endemic</span> to <span>Hawai&#x2BB;i</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The Hawaiian petrel was formerly found on all the main <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> except <span>Ni&#x2BB;ihau</span>, but today it is mostly restricted to <span>Haleakal&#x101;</span> crater on <span>Maui</span>; smaller populations exist on <span>Mauna Loa</span> on the island of <span>Hawai&#x2BB;i</span>, <span>Waimea Canyon</span> on the island of <span>Kaua&#x2BB;i</span>, L&#x101;na<span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>ihale on <span>L&#x101;na&#x2BB;i</span>, and possibly <span>Moloka&#x2BB;i</span>.</p>
<p>It is also reportedly seen on the <span>Galapagos Islands</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Their diet consists of 50&#x2013;75% <span>squid</span>, and smaller percentages of <span>fish</span> and <span>crustaceans</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The birds nest in <span>burrows</span> or rock crevices. The breeding extends from March to October. The female lays one white egg. When the chick hatches, the parents go out to sea and feed during the day, and return only at night. They pass their food on to the chicks by means of regurgitation. The chicks are charcoal-gray colored and were considered a delicacy by early Hawaiians. Scientists previously thought that the petrels remained relatively close to shore during the breeding season. New research employing microwave <span>telemetry</span> shows that the birds travel as far as <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Japan</span> during two-week long feeding trips.</p>
<p>When returning to nest burrows at night, adults make a distinctive moaning "oo-ah-oo". At their burrows, adult birds also make a variety of yaps, barks, and squeals. The petrel's flight is characterized by high, steeply banked arcs and glides. Their wings are long and narrow with a wingspan of 36 inches (91&#xA0;cm). The wings and tail are sooty-colored. Their feet are bicolored pink and black.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>The Hawaiian petrel is an endangered species. In addition to loss of habitat from development, the greatest threats to the petrel are <span>feral cats</span>, <span>small Asian mongooses</span>, and <span>rats</span>, all of which feed on the helpless chicks when they are inside their burrows. In <span>Haleakal&#x101; National Park</span>, great efforts are being made to reduce the number of feral animals, to preserve not only the Hawaiian petrel, but also many other rare Hawaiian birds that fall victim to predation. Wires injure the rare petrels and city lights disorient them, contributing to their decline. The Hawaiian petrel was once considered conspecific with the <span>dark-rumped petrel</span> of the <span>Gal&#xE1;pagos</span> islands, but was recently split to its own species.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of federal wildlife officials, Hawai<span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>i switched to digital television on 15 January 2009, a month ahead of the nationwide FCC mandatory conversion, in order to preserve the nesting season of the <span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>Ua<span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>u. Biologists didn't have an accurate count of how many of the species remained, but estimated fewer than 1,000 nested on Haleakal&#x101; volcano, their primary nesting area. The earlier digital conversion allowed nearby analog transmission towers to be destroyed without disrupting the nesting season, which begins in February.</p>
