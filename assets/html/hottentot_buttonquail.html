<p>The <b>black-rumped buttonquail</b> (<i>Turnix hottentottus</i>) is a small species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>buttonquail</span> genus.</p>
<p>It is found in open grassland through much of <span>Africa</span> outside the forested and more arid regions. It is resident in the central parts of the range but is a <span>migratory</span> breeder further north.</p>
<p>This species has a brown back, rufous chest, and pale belly. As usual for buttonquails but not for most birds, the female is larger and brighter than the male. This species is shy and difficult to flush.</p>
<p>Most of the range is occupied by the subspecies <i>T. h. nanus</i>, which has brown <span>irides</span> and a black rump, and is sometimes split into a distinct species. The nominate subspecies, <i>T. h. hottentottus</i>, the <b>Hottentot buttonquail</b>, which is confined to coastal <span>fynbos</span> in <span>South Africa</span>, has pale irides and a paler rump.</p>
