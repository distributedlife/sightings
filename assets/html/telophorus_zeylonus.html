<p>The <b>bokmakierie</b> (<i>Telophorus zeylonus</i>) is a bushshrike. This family of <span>passerine</span> birds is closely related to the true <span>shrikes</span> in the family Laniidae, and was once included in that group. This species is <span>endemic</span> to southern <span>Africa</span>, mainly in <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Namibia</span>, with an isolated population in the mountains of eastern <span>Zimbabwe</span> and western <span>Mozambique</span>.</p>
<p>It is a species of open habitats, including <span>karoo</span> scrub, <span>fynbos</span> and parks and gardens in urban areas. The bulky cup nest is constructed in a hedge, scrub or tree fork. The 2-6, usually three, red-brown or lilac-blotched greenish-blue eggs are incubated by both sexes for about 16 days to hatching, with another 18 days to fledging.</p>
<p>The adult bokmakierie is a 22&#x2013;23&#xA0;cm long bird with olive-green upperparts and a conspicuous bright yellow tip to the black tail. The head is grey with a yellow <span>supercilium</span>, and the strong bill has a hooked upper <span>mandible</span>. The underparts are bright yellow with a broad black collar between the throat and breast, which continues up the neck sides through the eye to the bill. The legs and feet are blue-grey. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are a dull grey-green below, and lack the black gorget.</p>
<p>There are four subspecies, differing mainly in colour shade and size. Although the species as a whole is not threatened, the isolated dark subspecies <i>restrictus</i> in the Chimanimani Mountains numbers only about 400 birds.</p>
<p>The bokmakierie has a range of loud whistles and calls, often given in duet, but the most typical is the one that gives this species its name, <i>bok-bok-mak-kik</i>.</p>
<p>Unlike the true shrikes, which perch conspicuously in the open, the bokmakierie is shy and <span>skulking</span>. This bird has a typical shrike diet of insects, small lizards, snakes, small birds and frogs. It is predated itself by snakes, <span>mongooses</span>, and large shrikes like the <span>northern fiscal</span> and <span>southern boubou</span>.</p>
