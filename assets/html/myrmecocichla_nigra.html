<p>The <b>sooty chat</b> (<i>Myrmecocichla nigra</i>) is an <span>African</span> <span>songbird</span> of the <span>chat</span> subfamily.</p>
<p>It is 15 to 16&#xA0;cm (6 to 6.25&#xA0;inches) long, stocky and relatively short-tailed for a chat. The adult male's plumage is glossy black except for white patches on the upper wings that are usually visible or only partly concealed (as in the photograph at upper right) when the bird is at rest. The female and young are very dark brown (Zimmerman, Turner, and Pearson 1999).</p>
<p>The song (in <span>Kenya</span> and northern <span>Tanzania</span>) is described as "prolonged, sweet and musical, sometimes given in flight, <i>wee tewee tuweer, skwik-skueeeeer, cueee-eeeee-cuweeeeer, eee-euwee-tee, tseuwee-tew-skweeer-tsi-seet&#x2026;.</i>" This species sometimes imitates other birds (Zimmerman, Turner, and Pearson 1999).</p>
<p>It occurs widely but discontinuously in African <span>grasslands</span>, from <span>Senegal</span> east to <span>Kenya</span> and south to <span>Angola</span> and <span>Zambia</span>. Its range is estimated at 3,400,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;, and it is considered "frequent" in at least parts of that area (Birdlife International 2004).</p>
