<p>The <b>Mariana fruit bat</b> (<i>Pteropus mariannus</i>), also known as the <b>Mariana flying fox</b>, and the <i><b>fanihi</b></i> in <span>Chamorro</span>, is a <span>megabat</span> found only on <span>Guam</span>, the Northern <span>Mariana Islands</span> and <span>Ulithi</span> (an <span>atoll</span> in the <span>Caroline Islands</span>). Habitat loss has driven it to endangered status, and it is listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. <span>Poachers</span> and food hunters, other animals, and natural causes have led to the decline.</p>
<p>The Mariana fruit bat is a mid-sized bat which weighs 0.6 to 1.1&#xA0;lb (270 to 500&#xA0;g), and has a forearm length of 5.3 to 6.1 in (13.4 to 15.6&#xA0;cm). Males of the species are slightly larger in size than the females. Their abdomens are colored from black to brown, while also having gray hairs. The mantle and the neck are a brighter brown to golden brown color and the head varies from brown to black. Their ears are rounded and their eyes large, giving them the features of a canid, so many megabats are called flying foxes.</p>
<p>The bat is considered a culinary delicacy by <span>Chamorros</span>. Eating fruit bats is linked to a neurological disease called <span>lytico-bodig disease</span>. <span>Paul Alan Cox</span> from the <span>Hawaiian National Tropical Botanical Garden</span> in <span>Kalaheo</span>, and <span>Oliver Sacks</span> from <span>Albert Einstein College</span> in <span>New York</span>, found the bats consumed large quantities of <span>cycad</span> seeds, and - like some eagles, which were shown to build up levels of the pesticide <span>DDT</span> in fat tissue - probably accumulate the toxins to dangerous levels.</p>
<p>In 2001, the population was estimated to number between 300 and 400 bats. The current population numbers are unknown, but one known concentration is on <span>Ritidian Point</span> in Guam.</p>
<p>Johnson and Wiles described roosting behavior: "<span>Sarigan</span>'s population differs from those of larger islands in the archipelago by usually having smaller roost sizes, typically 3-75 bats, and large numbers of solitary bats that at times comprise up to half of the population. Colonies and smaller aggregations were composed primarily of harems with multiple females, whereas a nearly equal sex ratio occurred among solitary animals."</p>
