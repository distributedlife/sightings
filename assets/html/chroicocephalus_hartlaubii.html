<p>The <b>Hartlaub's gull</b> or <b>king gull</b>, (<i><b>Chroicocephalus hartlaubii</b></i>) is a small <span>gull</span>, which is a <span>non-migratory</span> breeding resident endemic to the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> coastline of <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Namibia</span>. Although it is predominantly coastal or estuarine, it is not a pelagic species, and is rarely seen at sea far from land. It was formerly sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the <span>silver gull</span> (<i>C. novaehollandiae</i>), and, as is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Larus</span></i> but is now placed in the genus <i><span>Chroicocephalus</span></i>.</p>
<p>About one half of the total population, currently estimated at about 30&#xA0;000 birds, are within the Greater <span>Cape Town</span> area. It breeds in large colonies, and the main traditional breeding colony for the Cape Town area is on <span>Robben Island</span>. The adults fly to the mainland to find food for their chicks, a round trip of about 24&#xA0;km.</p>

<p>Hartlaub's gull is 36&#x2013;38&#xA0;cm in length. It is a mainly white gull with a grey back and upperwings, black wingtips with conspicuous white "mirrors", and a dark red bill and legs. When breeding it has a very faint lavender grey hood, but otherwise has a plain white head. Sexes are similar. This species differs from the slightly larger <span>grey-headed gull</span> in its thinner, darker bill, deeper red legs, paler, plainer head, and dark eyes.</p>
<p>The Hartlaub's gull takes two years to reach maturity. Juvenile birds have a brown band across the wings. They differ from same-age grey-headed gulls in that they lack a black terminal tail band, less dark areas in the wings, darker legs, and a white head.</p>
<p>Hartlaub's gull has accommodated well to humans, and can become very tame around habitations. It is an omnivore like most <i>larus</i> gulls, and they will scavenge at tips and feed on scraps as well as seeking suitable small prey, often by wading in shallow water.</p>
<p>Although it is a relatively rare species, about the tenth rarest of the world's 50 or so gull species, it is common in its range and is widely regarded in Cape Town as a nuisance, fouling buildings and bathing in urban ponds. It has, at times, been a hazard to aircraft near airports.</p>
<p>Like most gulls, it is highly gregarious in winter, both when feeding or in evening roosts. This is a noisy species, especially at colonies. The call is a raucous <span>crow</span>-like <i>kaaarrh</i>. This species is frequently the subject of complaints about the noise it makes in urban areas.</p>
<p>This species&#x2019; name commemorates the German physician and zoologist, <span>Gustav Hartlaub</span>.</p>
