<p>The <b>Oriental cuckoo</b> or <b>Horsfields cuckoo</b> (<i>Cuculus optatus</i>) is a <span>bird</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Cuculus</span></i> in the <span>cuckoo</span> family Cuculidae. It was formerly classified as a <span>subspecies</span> of the <span>Himalayan cuckoo</span> (<i>C. saturatus</i>) with the name Oriental cuckoo used for the combined species. Differences in voice and size suggest that they should be treated as a separate species. The <span>binomial name</span> <i>Cuculus horsfieldi</i> has often been used instead of <i>Cuculus optatus</i> but is now usually considered to be a <span>junior synonym</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is 30-32 centimetres long with a wingspan of 51-57 centimetres and a weight of 73-156 grams. The adult male has a grey head, breast and upperparts. The belly is creamy-white with dark bars. The vent is frequently buff with few markings. The legs and feet are orange-yellow and there is a bare yellow ring around the eye. Adult females and <span>juveniles</span> occur in two <span>morphs</span>. The grey morph is similar to the male but has a brownish wash on the breast. The rufous morph is reddish-brown above, paler on the underparts and with strong dark barring all over including the rump.</p>

<p>The <span>common cuckoo</span> (<i>C. canorus</i>) is very similar in appearance but is slightly bulkier with longer wings and tail and a slightly smaller head and bill. It is slightly paler grey and the barring on the underparts is a little narrower. The vent is usually white with dark bars but is more similar to Oriental cuckoo in a few individuals. Birds of the rufous morph have a plain rump with no dark bars unlike the Oriental cuckoo.</p>
<p>The Himalayan cuckoo (<i>C. saturatus</i>) is extremely similar to the Oriental cuckoo but is slightly smaller and shorter-winged.</p>
<p>The call of the male Oriental cuckoo is a series of low paired notes, <i>poo-poo</i>, with both notes stressed equally. It is somewhat similar to the call of the <span>Hoopoe</span>. It may be introduced with a four to eight note phrase or sometimes with grating notes. The female's call is a deep bubbling trill. Outside the breeding season, the birds are usually silent. The call of the male Himalayan cuckoo is a series of three or four note phrases with a short, high-pitched introductory note.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>It has a large breeding range in northern <span>Eurasia</span>. It breeds across much of <span>Russia</span> west to the <span>Komi Republic</span> with occasional records as far west as <span>Saint Petersburg</span>. It also breeds in northern <span>Kazakhstan</span>, <span>Mongolia</span>, northern <span>China</span>, <span>Korea</span> and <span>Japan</span>. There have been records of birds displaying in <span>Finland</span> in recent years but their identification is no longer considered certain.</p>
<p>The exact extent of its wintering range is uncertain due to its secretive habits and the difficulty of separating it from the Himalayan cuckoo and other similar species. It is believed to include the <span>Malay Peninsula</span>, <span>Indonesia</span>, the <span>Philippines</span>, <span>New Guinea</span>, western <span>Micronesia</span>, the <span>Solomon Islands</span> and northern and eastern <span>Australia</span> with occasional birds reaching <span>New Zealand</span>. It has occurred as a <span>vagrant</span> in <span>Ukraine</span>, <span>Israel</span> and <span>Alaska</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>It mainly inhabits <span>forests</span>, occurring in <span>coniferous</span>, <span>deciduous</span> and mixed forest. It feeds mainly on <span>insects</span> and their <span>larvae</span>, foraging for them in trees and bushes as well as on the ground. It is usually secretive and hard to see.</p>
<p>It is a <span>brood parasite</span>, laying its <span>eggs</span> in the nests of other birds. The nests of <i><span>Phylloscopus</span></i> warblers such as the <span>Arctic warbler</span>, <span>eastern crowned warbler</span>, <span>willow warbler</span> and <span>Chiffchaff</span> are commonly used. Other hosts include the <span>olive-backed pipit</span> and <span>Asian stubtail</span>. The eggs are smooth, slightly glossy and vary in colour, sometimes mimicking those of the host species. They are <span>incubated</span> for about 12 days. The young cuckoo is born naked and has an orange <span>gape</span> with black patches. Within a few days it pushes the eggs or young of the host out of the nest. Older nestlings have blackish feathers with white fringes; the belly is dark brown with white bands. The young birds <span>fledge</span> after around 17&#x2013;19 days.</p>
