<p>The <b>River Warbler</b> (<i>Locustella fluviatilis</i>) is an <span>Old World warbler</span> in the <span>grass warbler</span> genus <i>Locustella</i>. It breeds in east and central <span>Europe</span> into western <span>Asia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in east <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>This small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> is a species found in dense deciduous vegetation close to water in bogs or near a river. 5-7 <span>eggs</span> are laid in a nest in a tussock or on the ground. This species is a rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>. In Britain, a small number of males have set up <span>territories</span> in spring, including a bird in <span>Greater Manchester</span> in 1995.</p>
<p>This is a largish warbler. The adult has an unstreaked grey-brown back, whitish grey underparts, and a darker undertail, which has white feather tips giving a contrasting pattern. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is <span>insectivorous</span>.</p>
<p>Some birds can show reduced dark markings on the <span>undertail-coverts</span> (caused by more extensive than usual white tips) and thus be closer in appearance to <span>Savi's Warbler</span> than typical birds; however they typically still have a streaked breast and more olive upperparts coloration.</p>
<p>This is a skulky species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.</p>
<p>The song is a monotonous mechanical <span>insect</span>-like reeling, often given at dusk. It is similar to the song of other species in the group, but has more of a sewing machine quality, and may be produced for long periods.</p>
