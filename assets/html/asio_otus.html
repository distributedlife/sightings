<p>The <b>long-eared owl</b> (<i>Asio otus</i>, previously <i>Strix otus</i>) is a species of <span>owl</span> which breeds in <span>Europe</span>, <span>Asia</span>, and <span>North America</span>. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as <span>typical owls</span>, family <span>Strigidae</span>, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping of owls are the <span>barn owls</span>, family <span>Tytonidae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The long-eared owl is a medium sized owl, 31&#x2013;40&#xA0;cm (12&#x2013;16&#xA0;in) in length with an 86&#x2013;100&#xA0;cm (34&#x2013;39&#xA0;in) wingspan and a body mass of 178&#x2013;435&#xA0;g (6.3&#x2013;15.3&#xA0;oz). It has erect blackish ear-tufts, which are positioned in the center of the head. The ear-tufts are used to make the owl appear larger to other owls while perched. The female is larger in size and darker in coloration than the male. The long-eared owl's brownish feathers are vertically streaked. <span>Tarsus</span> and toes are entirely feathered. Eye disks are also characteristic in this species. However, the eye disks of <i>A. otus</i> are darker in color or rusty-orange. This <span>nocturnal</span> species is perhaps most easily seen perched in a tree in its daytime roost, sometimes in small groups during the winter months.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Separation_from_short-eared_owl">Separation from short-eared owl</span></h3>
<p>Over much of its range, long-eared owls occur with the similar-looking <span>short-eared owl</span>. At rest, the ear-tufts of the long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owls can sometimes hold their ear-tufts flat). The iris-colour differs: yellow in short-eared, and orange in long-eared, and the black surrounding the eyes is vertical on long-eared, and horizontal on short-eared. Overall, the short-eared owl tends to be a paler, sandier bird than the long-eared. There are a number of other ways in which the two species differ which are best seen when they are flying:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The long-eared owl's breeding season is from February to July. This <span>bird</span> is partially <span>migratory</span>, moving south in winter from the northern parts of its temperate range. Its habitat is forest close to open country. Overall, these owls are secretive, and are rarely seen.</p>
<p>It nests in trees, often <span>coniferous</span>, using the old stick nests of other <span>birds</span> such as <span>crows</span>, <span>ravens</span> and <span>magpies</span> and various <span>hawks</span>. The average clutch size is 4&#x2013;6 eggs, and the incubation time averages from 25&#x2013;30 days. It will readily use artificial nesting baskets. An unusual characteristic of this species is its communal roosting in thickets during the winter months. The young have a characteristic call, likened to a rusty hinge.</p>
<p>The long-eared owl hunts over open country by night. It is very long winged, like the similar <span>short-eared owl</span>, and glides slowly on stiff wings when hunting. Its food is mainly <span>rodents</span>, small <span>mammals</span>, and <span>birds</span>. In Europe it faces competition from the <span>tawny owl</span> and is most numerous in localities where the tawny is absent, notably in <span>Ireland</span>, where it is the dominant owl.</p>

<p><span>John James Audubon</span> illustrates the "Long-eared Owl - <i>Strix otus</i>" as Plate 383 in Birds of America, published London, 1827-38. The print was engraved by Robert Havell in 1837. The original watercolor was purchased from Audubon's destitute widow by The New York History Society where it remains to this day.</p>
