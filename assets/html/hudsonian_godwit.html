<p>The <b>Hudsonian godwit</b> (<i>Limosa haemastica</i>) is a large <span>shorebird</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>Adults have long dark legs and a long pink bill with a slight upward curve and dark at the tip. The upper parts are mottled brown and the underparts are chestnut. The tail is black and the rump is white. They show black wing linings in flight.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>Their breeding habitat is the far north near the tree line in northwestern <span>Canada</span> and <span>Alaska</span>, also on the shores of <span>Hudson Bay</span>. They nest on the ground, in a well-concealed location in a <span>marshy</span> area. The female usually lays four eggs. Both parents look after the young birds, who find their own food and are able to fly within a month of hatching.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h2>
<p>They <span>migrate</span> to <span>South America</span>. These birds gather at <span>James Bay</span> before fall migration. In good weather, many birds make the trip south without stopping. They are a vagrant to <span>Australia</span> and South Africa.</p>
<p>They can perhaps be most easily seen in migration on the east coast of North America where they can be plentiful in migration in Late July through early August.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>These birds forage by probing in shallow water. They mainly eat insects and <span>crustaceans</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_history">Conservation history</span></h2>
<p>Their numbers were reduced by hunting at the end of the 19th century.</p>
