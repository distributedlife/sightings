<p>The <b>citrine wagtail</b> or <b>yellow-headed wagtail</b> (<i>Motacilla citreola</i>) is a small <span>songbird</span> in the <span>family</span> <span>Motacillidae</span>. The term <span>citrine</span> refers to its yellowish colouration. Its <span>systematics</span>, <span>phylogeny</span> and <span>taxonomy</span> are subject of considerable debate in the early 21st century. This is because this bird forms a <span>cryptic species complex</span> with the <span>eastern</span> (<i>M. tschutschensis</i> ) and <span>western yellow wagtail</span> (<i>M. flava</i>). Which of the many <span>taxa</span> in this group should properly refer to which <span>population</span> is unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future.</p>
<p>It is a slender, 15.5&#x2013;17&#xA0;cm long bird, with the long, constantly wagging tail characteristic of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Motacilla</span></i>. The adult male in breeding plumage is basically grey or black above, with white on the <span>remiges</span>, and bright yellow below and on the entire head except for the black nape. In winter plumage, its yellow underparts may be diluted by white, and the head is brownish with a yellowish <span>supercilium</span>. Females look generally like washed-out versions of males in winter plumage.</p>
<p>This species breeds in north central <span>Asia</span> in wet meadows and <span>tundra</span>. It <span>migrates</span> in winter to south Asia, often to highland areas. Its range is expanding westwards, and it is a rare but increasing vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>. Vagrants seem to extend the migration rather than straying <span>en route</span>; in <span>Bhutan</span> for example, though along one of the species' migration <span>flyways</span>, the citrine wagtail has been recorded as an extremely rare passer-by rather than staying even for a few days or weeks.</p>
<p>It is an <span>insectivorous</span> <span>bird</span> of open country near water, such as wet meadows and bogs, and nests on the ground, laying 4&#x2013;5 speckled eggs.</p>
