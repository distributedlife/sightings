<p>The <b>Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross</b> (<i>Thalassarche chlororhynchos</i>) is a large <span>seabird</span> in the <span>albatross</span> <span>family</span>. This small <span>mollymawk</span> was once considered <span>conspecific</span> with the <span>Indian yellow-nosed albatross</span> and known as the <b>yellow-nosed albatross</b>. Some authorities still believe the <span>species</span> to be the same, such as Jeff Clements and the <span>SACC</span>, which recognizes that a proposal is needed.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Mollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to <span>Diomedeidae</span> family and come from the <span>Procellariiformes</span> order, along with <span>shearwaters</span>, <span>fulmars</span>, <span>storm petrels</span>, and <span>diving petrels</span>. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>, although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross averages 81&#xA0;cm (32&#xA0;in) in length. It is a typical black and white mollymawk with a grey head and large <span>eye</span> patch, and its nape and hindneck are white. Its bill is black with a yellow <span>culmenicorn</span> and a pink tip. It has a blackish grey saddle, tail and upperwing, and its underparts are predominantly white. Its underwing and <span>primaries</span> show a narrow black margin. The juvenile is similar to the adult but with a white head and black bill. It can be differentiated from the Indian yellow-nosed by its darker head. Relative to other mollymawks it can be distinguished by its smaller size (the wings being particularly narrow) and the thin black edging to the underwing, The <span>grey-headed albatross</span> has a similar grey head but more extensive and less well defined black markings around the edge of the underwing. <span>Salvin's albatross</span> also has a grey head but has much broader wings, a pale bill and even narrower black borders to the underwing.</p>

<p>Like all albatrosses they are <span>colonial</span>, but unusually they will build their <span>nests</span> in scrub or amongst <i><span>Blechnum</span></i> <span>tree ferns</span>. Like all mollymawks they build pedestal nests of mud, peat, feathers, and vegetation to lay their one <span>egg</span> in. They do this in September or early October, and the chick <span>fledges</span> in late March to April. They breed annually.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range">Range</span></h2>
<p>Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses nest on <span>islands</span> in the mid-<span>Atlantic</span>, including <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> (<span>Inaccessible Island</span>, <span>Middle Island</span>, <span>Nightingale Island</span>, <span>Stoltenhoff Island</span>) and <span>Gough Island</span>. At sea they range across the south Atlantic from <span>South America</span> to <span>Africa</span> between <span>15&#xB0;S</span> and <span>45&#xB0;S</span>.</p>

<p>The <span>IUCN</span> list this species as <span>endangered</span>, with an occurrence range of 16,800,000&#xA0;km (6,500,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) and a breeding range of 80&#xA0;km (31&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). A 2001 population estimate breaks down the population and shows some trends. <span>Gough Island</span> has 5,300 breeding pairs, between 16,000 and 30,000 breeding pairs on <span>Tristan da Cunha Island</span>, 4,500 on <span>Nightingale Island</span>, between 100 and 200 pairs on <span>Middle Island</span>, and 500 pairs on <span>Stoltenhoff Island</span>, and 1,100 on <span>Inaccessible Island</span>. This adds up to between 27,500 and 41,600 pairs per year for the total between 55,000 and 83,200 total adult birds. This population estimate was done in 1983, however and is outdated. Trends suggest a 50% decrease over 72 years.</p>
<p>The largest threat is from <span>longline fishing</span>, as harvesting of chicks and adults has been outlawed.</p>
<p>Efforts to help conserve this bird are underway, with counting of the birds on <span>Gough Island</span>. Also, Gough Island and <span>Inaccessible Island</span> are nature preserves, and Gough Island is a <span>World Heritage Site</span>. The <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> population is being remotely tracked and counted, and the <span>South East Atlantic Fisheries Commission</span> has passed a resolution that all fishing vessels use a <span>tori line</span> and drop lines at night.</p>
