<p>The <b>Mountain Ground Squirrel</b> (<i>Xerus princeps</i>) is a <span>rodent</span> that is native to southwestern <span>Angola</span>, western <span>Namibia</span>, and western <span>South Africa</span>. It is also known as the <b><span>Kaoko</span> Ground Squirrel</b> or the <b>Damara Ground Squirrel</b>.</p>
<p>It is the closest relative of the <span>Cape Ground Squirrel</span> (Latin name <i>Xerus inauris</i>), which is so similar in appearance that the two are difficult to distinguish in the field. Both species have long bushy black and white tails with a white stripe from the shoulder towards the rump. <i>Xerus princeps</i> is slightly larger, on average, than <i>X. inauris</i>, although there is considerable overlap in body size. Differences in skull <span>morphology</span> also distinguish the two species, and the <span>incisors</span> are yellow to orange rather than white as in <i>X. inauris</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The mountain ground squirrel is restricted to a narrow band of the southwest arid region of Africa from southern <span>Angola</span> to southern <span>Namibia</span> and as far south as <span>Richtersveld National Park</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The mountain ground squirrel is a large-bodied squirrel with small ears. The total length of head and body measures 23 to 29&#xA0;cm (9.1 to 11.4&#xA0;in), tail length from 21 to 28&#xA0;cm (8.3 to 11.0&#xA0;in), and weight ranges from 490 to 710 grams (1.1 to 1.6&#xA0;lb). The body is covered in short, pale cinnamon brown hair, which changes to white on the belly, around the eyes, and on the front of the face. A white stripe extends from shoulders to hips. There is no underfur, and the skin is black. Tail hairs are white with three black stripes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Mountain ground squirrels are strictly <span>diurnal</span>. Adult females may live alone or in small family groups, while males are mostly solitary. In contrast to the <span>Cape Ground Squirrel</span>, they are not known to exhibit <span>play</span> behaviors, <span>allogrooming</span>, or other social behaviors. They build burrows in areas with sparse cover. In the daytime, they may range up to 1&#xA0;km (0.6&#xA0;mi) from the home burrow in search of food.</p>
