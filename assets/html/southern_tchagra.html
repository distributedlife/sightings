<p>The <b>southern tchagra</b> (<i>Tchagra tchagra</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> found in dense scrub and coastal bush in southern and south-eastern <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>.</p>
<p>This species is a <span>bushshrike</span>, a group closely related to the true <span>shrikes</span> in the family Laniidae, and formerly included in that family.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>The southern tchagra is 17&#x2013;21&#xA0;cm in length. It has a brown crown and black eye stripes separated by a broad white <span>supercilium</span>. The underparts are pale grey and the upperparts pale brown. The folded wings are chestnut and the tail is black, tipped white. The longish bill is black. The sexes are similar, but young birds are duller and have a buff stripe through the eye. This species is similar to the <span>black-crowned tchagra</span>, but that species is larger, and the adult, as its name implies, has a black rather than brown crown.</p>
<p>An identification pitfall is that juvenile black-crowned tchagra has a brown crown. It can be separated from southern tchagra by its larger size, relatively shorter bill and paler underparts.</p>
<p>There are three fairly similar subspecies of southern tchagra. Nominate <i>T. t. tchagra</i> of the Western Cape has the darkest underparts and longest bill. <i>T. t. caffrariae</i> has paler underparts and the shortest bill, and <i>T. t. natalensis</i> of eastern South Africa and Swaziland has the palest underparts and a reddish-brown crown.</p>
<p>The male southern tchagra has a descending whistling song, <i>ttttrtr te te te teuuu</i> given in its display flight or from a perch. The female responds with a trilled <i>tzerrrrrrrr</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The cup nest is constructed of twigs and stems in a branch fork in a bush or scrub. Two, sometimes three <span>eggs</span> are laid. These are white, marked with grey and reddish-brown, and hatch after about 16 days, with another 14 days to fledging.</p>
<p>This is a solitary territorial species, less conspicuously than true shrikes, especially when breeding. It forages on the ground for <span>insects</span> and other small prey.</p>
