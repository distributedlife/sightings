<p>The <b>Drakensberg rockjumper</b> or <b>orange-breasted rockjumper</b> (<i>Chaetops aurantius</i>) is a medium-sized insectivorous <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> endemic to the <span>alpine</span> <span>grasslands</span> and rock outcrops of the <span>Drakensberg Mountains</span> of southeastern <span>South Africa</span>. It is sometimes included with the <span>allopatric</span> <span>Cape rockjumper</span> in <i>C. frenatus</i>; the two are the only living <span>species</span> of the <span>Chaetopidae</span> (rockjumper family) if this is not merged with the <span>Picathartidae</span> (rockfowl).</p>
<p>This <span>rockjumper</span> is 23&#x2013;25&#xA0;cm long with a long black tail and strong legs. The male has a dark grey head with a thin white <span>supercilium</span> and a broad white moustache. The back and wings are dark grey.</p>

<p>The underparts are orange and the rump is rufous red. The female and juvenile have a paler grey head, upperparts and wings, a duller head pattern, an orange rump, and <span>buff</span> <span>underparts</span>. The call is a loud <i>wheeoo</i>. The Cape rockjumper male has rufous red underparts, and the female and young are darker buff below than in <i>C. aurantius</i>.</p>
<p>This is a ground-nesting species which forages on rocky slopes and scree. It frequently perches on rocks. The Cape rockjumper uses one or two additional individuals, usually a pair's offspring of the preceding breeding season, to assist the parents in territorial defence and alarm calling, and in the feeding of nestlings and fledglings. Given the great similarities between the species, it is likely that Drakensberg rockjumper uses a similar strategy.</p>
