<p>The <b>Neddicky</b>, or <b>Piping Cisticola</b>, (<i>Cisticola fulvicapilla</i>), is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. The common name <b>Neddicky</b> is used from the <span>Afrikaans</span> name for the species, as it is commonly known.</p>
<p>This <span>cisticola</span> is a resident breeder in much of Africa from <span>Gabon</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of Congo</span>, <span>Rwanda</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> south to the <span>Cape</span>.</p>
<p>The Neddicky is a very common bird of open woodland, including <span>savannah</span> with trees and open plantations of exotic species. It avoids densely wooded habitats.</p>

<p>The Neddicky is a small, vocal, dull-coloured brown bird, 11&#xA0;cm in length. Its tail is not as short as that of some other <span>cisticola</span> species. This bird has a reddish cap and a plain back. The underparts are buff, darker in tone on the breast. The brown bill is short and straight, and the feet and legs are pinkish-brown. The eye is light brown. The sexes are similar, but juvenile birds are yellower.</p>
<p>The southern form found in the <span>western Cape Province</span> has grey underparts and a grey-brown back. Although <span>cisticolas</span> can be very similar in plumage, this greyish subspecies is therefore quite distinctive.</p>
<p>The call of the Neddicky is a monotonous, penetrating, repetitive <i>weep weep weep</i>. The alarm call is a loud clicking <i>tictictictic</i>, like a fingernail running across the teeth of a comb.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Neddicky builds a ball-shaped <span>nest</span> with a side entrance from dry grass, <span>cobwebs</span> and felted plant down. The nest is placed low in a thorny shrub, or in thick grass. In <span>South Africa</span>, this bird breeds mainly from September to March.</p>
<p>The Neddicky is usually seen in pairs or singly, flitting in a bush or the grass at the base of a tree as it forages for small <span>insects</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 4,100,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;. The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <span>IUCN Red List</span> (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three <span>generations</span>). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
