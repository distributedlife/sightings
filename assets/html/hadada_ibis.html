<p>The hadeda is a large (about 76&#xA0;cm long), grey-to-partly brown species of <span>ibis</span>. It has a narrow, white, roughly horizontal stripe across its cheeks. This is sometimes called the "moustache" though it does not reach the mouth corners. The plumage over the wings has an <span>iridescent</span> purple sheen. The bird has blackish legs and a large grey-to-black <span>bill</span> with a red stripe on the upper mandible. The upper surfaces of the toes are of a similar red. The wings are powerful and broad, enabling quick take-offs and easy manoeuvring through dense tree cover.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Call">Call</span></h3>
<p>It has a loud and distinctive "haa-haa-haa-de-dah" call that is often heard when the birds are flying or are startled, hence the name. While roosting they produce a single loud "haaaa". When foraging, their contact call is a low growl similar to that made by a young puppy.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_distribution">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>
<p>The hadeda ibis is found throughout <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span> in open <span>grasslands</span>, <span>savanna</span> and <span>wetlands</span>, as well as urban parks, school fields, green corridors and large gardens. This bird occurs in <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Burundi</span> <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Gabon</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of Congo</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Gambia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Somalia</span> and <span>South Africa</span>.</p>

<p>It feeds mainly on <span>earthworms</span>, using its long <span>scimitar</span>-like bill to probe soft soil. It also eats larger <span>insects</span>, such as the <span>Parktown prawn</span>, as well as <span>spiders</span> and small <span>lizards</span>. These birds also favour <span>snails</span> and will feed in garden beds around residential homes. They are particularly welcomed on bowling and golf greens because they are assiduous in extracting larvae of moths and beetles that feed on the roots of the grass. It is not clear how they detect these, but it seems likely that they can hear their chewing and digging.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large <span>range</span>, the hadeda ibis is evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</span>.</p>
