<p>The <b>Damara Canary</b>, <i>Serinus leucolaema</i>, is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>finch</span> <span>family</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Damara Canary is 12-15 cm in length. The adult male has rich brown upperparts and tail, a white hind collar and mainly white underparts. The head pattern is striking; whereas male Black-headed Canary has a solidly black head and central breast, Damara has a white <span>supercilium</span>, and white throat and fore neck with a black moustachial stripe. The black of the central breast is therefore separate from the black of the head.</p>
<p>The adult female is similar, but has a dull grey head, and is dark-streaked on the head and upperparts. It has a rich brown wing bar. The female is similar to female Black-headed Canary, but shows faint traces of the male head pattern. The juvenile resembles the female, but is paler, has streaking on the breast, and a weaker wing bar.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is a resident breeder in <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Namibia</span> and southern <span>Botswana</span>. It is sometimes placed in genus <i>Alario</i> as <i>Alario leucolaema</i>, and some authorities treat it as a subspecies of <span>Black-headed Canary</span>, <i>Serinus alario</i>. Its <span>habitat</span> is dry open scrub and grassland, edges of cultivation, and suburban gardens.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Damara Canary is a common and gregarious seed-eater, forming flocks of up to 200 birds. Its call is a low <i>tseett</i>, and the male&#x2019;s song is jumble of unmusical notes.</p>
