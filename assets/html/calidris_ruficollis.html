<p>The <b>red-necked stint</b> (<i>Calidris ruficollis</i>) is a small migratory <span>wader</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>These birds are among the smallest of waders, very similar to the <span>little stint</span>, <i>Calidris minuta</i>, with which they were once considered conspecific. The red-necked stint's small size, fine dark bill, dark legs and quicker movements distinguish this species from all waders except the other dark-legged stints. It measures 13&#x2013;17&#xA0;cm (5.1&#x2013;6.7&#xA0;in) in length, 28&#x2013;37&#xA0;cm (11&#x2013;15&#xA0;in) in wingspan and 21&#x2013;51&#xA0;g (0.74&#x2013;1.80&#xA0;oz) in body mass. It can be distinguished from the <span>western sandpiper</span> and the <span>semipalmated sandpiper</span> in all plumages by its combination of a fine bill tip, unwebbed toes, and longer primary projection.</p>
<p>The breeding adult has an unstreaked orange breast, bordered with dark markings below, and a white V on its back. In winter plumage identification is difficult, although it is shorter legged and longer winged than the <span>little stint</span>. Juveniles have more contrasting mantle plumage and weaker white lines down the back than their relative. The call is a hoarse "stit".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Red-necked stints are strongly <span>migratory</span>, breeding along the <span>Arctic</span> <span>littoral</span> of eastern <span>Eurasia</span> and spending the non-breeding season in <span>South East Asia</span> and <span>Australasia</span> as far south as <span>Tasmania</span> and <span>New Zealand</span>. They are rare vagrants to western <span>Europe</span>. They are often seen in western <span>Alaska</span> and occasionally elsewhere in the <span>Americas</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Red-necked stints are highly gregarious, and will form flocks with other small <i>Calidris</i> waders, such as <span>sharp-tailed sandpipers</span> and <span>curlew sandpipers</span> in their non-breeding areas. See it here with curlew sandpiper.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Their breeding habitat is <span>tundra</span>. They nest on the ground and breed from spring to summer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>They forage in wet grassland and soft mud, mainly picking up food by sight. In their non-breeding habitat they feed on intertidal mudflats and along the muddy margins of freshwater lakes. They mainly eat insects and other small invertebrates.</p>
