<p>The <b>Square-tailed Drongo</b> (<i>Dicrurus ludwigii</i>) is a <span>drongo</span> named after <span>Baron von Ludwig</span>. The drongos are small <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> of the Old World tropics. They were previously classed as the family <span>Dicruridae</span>, but that has been much enlarged to include a number of largely Australasian groups, such as the <span>Australasian fantails</span>, <span>monarchs and paradise flycatchers</span>.</p>
<p>The Square-tailed Drongo is a common resident breeder in much of <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. These <span>insect</span>-eating birds are usually found in forests or dense bush. Two to three <span>eggs</span> are laid in a cup nest in a fork high in a tree.</p>
<p>These are aggressive and fearless birds, given their small size, at 19&#xA0;cm, and will attack much larger species if their nest or young are threatened.</p>
<p>The male is mainly glossy black, although the wings are duller. The female is similar but less glossy. The bill is black and heavy, and the eye is red.</p>
<p>This species is similar to the <span>Fork-tailed Drongo</span>, but is smaller, and the shorter tail lacks the deep fork which gives the latter species its name. Fork-tailed is also typically found in more open habitat.</p>
<p>The Square-tailed Drongo has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a <span>shrike</span>. It flycatches or take prey from the ground.</p>
<p>The call is a harsh <i>cherit-cherit</i>.</p>
