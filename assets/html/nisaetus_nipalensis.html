<p>The <b>mountain hawk-eagle</b> or <b>Hodgson's hawk-eagle</b> (<i>Nisaetus nipalensis</i>, earlier treated under <i>Spizaetus</i>) is a <span>bird of prey</span>. Like all <span>eagles</span>, it is in the family <span>Accipitridae</span>. It breeds in the <span>Indian subcontinent</span>, from <span>India</span>, <span>Nepal</span> to <span>Thailand</span>, <span>Taiwan</span>, <span>Indonesia</span> and <span>Japan</span>.</p>
<p>The mountain hawk-eagle is a medium-large raptor at 69&#x2013;84&#xA0;cm (27&#x2013;33&#xA0;in) in length and a wingspan of 134&#x2013;175&#xA0;cm (53&#x2013;69&#xA0;in). The typical adult has brown upperparts and pale underparts, with barring on the undersides of the flight <span>feathers</span> and tail. The breast and belly and underwing coverts are heavily streaked. The wings are broad with a curved trailing edge, and are held in a shallow V in flight. Sexes are similar, but young birds are often whiter-headed.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan and south Indian population is smaller and has unstreaked buff underwing coverts. A 2008 study based on the geographic isolation and differences in call suggest that this be treated as a full species, <i>Nisaetus kelaarti</i>, <span>Legge's hawk-eagle</span>.</p>
<p>The Japanese subspecies <i>N. n. orientalis</i> is larger, lighter, and has only a very small crest, which is large in the other two subspecies. The Japanese subspecies usually weighs 2.2&#x2013;3.6&#xA0;kg (4.8&#x2013;8&#xA0;lbs).</p>
<p>The heavier underpart streaking and wing shape help to distinguish this species from the similar <span>crested hawk-eagle</span> (<i>Nisaetus cirrhatus</i>).</p>
<p>It is a <span>bird</span> of mountain woodland, which builds a stick nest in a tree and lays usually a single <span>egg</span>. Mountain hawk-eagles eat small <span>mammals</span>, birds and <span>reptiles</span>.</p>
<p>Though it is not considered a globally <span>threatened species</span>, the Japanese population is declining. As the species is a <span>K-strategist</span> like all eagles, it was feared that the ongoing population reduction of <i>N. n. orientalis</i> might lead to loss of genetic diversity, and consequently <span>inbreeding depression</span>. However, genetic diversity was shown to be still considerable at present.</p>
