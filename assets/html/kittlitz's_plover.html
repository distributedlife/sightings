<p>The <b>Kittlitz&#x2019;s plover</b> (<i>Charadrius pecuarius</i>) is a small <span>plover</span> found in much of <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>, <span>Madagascar</span>, and the <span>Nile</span> delta. Some birds, especially in coastal areas, are resident, other populations are <span>migratory</span> or nomadic.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The adult Kittlitz&#x2019;s plover is 14&#x2013;16&#xA0;cm long. In breeding plumage it has a grey-brown back, crown, and wings, an orange breast shading to white on the lower belly, and long dark grey legs. The forehead and throat are white, with black lores and a black frontal bar, the latter extending as a stripe down the sides of the neck and around the hind neck.</p>
<p>In winter, the adults lose the distinctive face pattern and resemble <span>Kentish plovers</span>, but they are smaller, longer-legged and <span>longer-billed</span>. They have less uniform upperparts than Kentish, and always show a pink or orange breast colouration. Juvenile Kittlitz&#x2019;s plovers are similar to winter adults, but the underpart colour is often restricted to just a narrow gorget. In flight, the primary <span>flight feathers</span> are dark with a short white wing bar.</p>
<p>The Kittlitz&#x2019;s plover forages for food on open dry mud and short grass, usually close to water. The specific name, <i>pecuarius</i>, means "grazer", referring to the grassland habitat. It hunts usually by sight for <span>invertebrates</span> including <span>insects</span>, <span>earthworms</span>, <span>crustaceans</span>, and <span>molluscs</span>.</p>
<p>The call is a plaintive <i>tee peep</i> and may give a hard <i>trip</i> when alarmed.</p>
<p>This species is named for Baron <span>Heinrich von Kittlitz</span>. It is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>Its breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or dry mudflats, near water, and with little or no plant growth. The nest is a simple scrape, and both parents incubate the usually two eggs. If a potential predator approaches the nest, the adult will walk away from the scrape, calling to attract the intruder and feigning a broken wing. Of course, once the intruder is far enough from the nest, the plover flies off. If the adult has enough warning, she will stand above the eggs and shuffle sand and debris over them before moving away from the nest.</p>
<p>Kittlitz&#x2019;s plover is gregarious outside the breeding season, feeding and roosting in mostly small groups, but in flocks of up to 250 on migration.</p>
