<p>The <b>Sooty Falcon</b> (<i>Falco concolor</i>) is a medium-sized <span>falcon</span> breeding from northeastern <span>Africa</span> to the southern <span>Persian Gulf</span> region. It belongs to the <span>hobby</span> group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often considered a <span>subgenus</span> <i><span>Hypotriorchis</span></i>. <span>Eleonora's Falcon</span> is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly belong to the same lineage, they do not seem to be close <span>sister species</span>.</p>
<p>This is an elegant <span>bird of prey</span>, 32&#x2013;37&#xA0;cm long with a 78&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm wingspan. It is shaped like a large <span>Hobby</span> or a small <span>Eleonora's Falcon</span>, with its long pointed wings, long tail and slim body. The adults are blue-grey, and lack the black underwing coverts of the Eleonora&#x2019;s Falcon. The young bird is like a large juvenile Hobby, or small juvenile Eleanora&#x2019;s Falcon. Its dark trailing edge to the wings and tail distinguish it from the former species, and it lacks the underwing contrast caused by the dark coverts of the larger falcon.</p>
<p>This species breeds on islands and coastal or <span>desert</span> cliffs from <span>Libya</span> to <span>Pakistan</span>). It is a long-distance <span>migrant</span>, wintering in <span>east Africa</span> and south to <span>Madagascar</span>. It is a rare vagrant north of its breeding range.</p>
<p>The Sooty Falcon eats mainly birds, but it will take large <span>insects</span>, such as <span>dragonflies</span>, which are transferred from talons to beak and eaten in flight. It nests on a ledge or on rocks, laying up to four <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>It was formerly classified as a Species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. But new research has shown it to be rarer than it was believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to <span>Near Threatened</span> status in 2008.</p>
