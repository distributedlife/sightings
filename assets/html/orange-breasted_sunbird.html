<p>The <b>Orange-breasted Sunbird</b> (<i>Anthobaphes violacea</i>) is the <span>only member</span> of the bird <span>genus</span> <i>Anthobaphes</i>, however it is sometimes placed in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Nectarinia</span></i>. This <span>sunbird</span> is <span>endemic</span> to the <span>fynbos</span> habitat of southwestern <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>As with other sunbirds the <span>bill</span> is long and decurved, that of the <span>male being longer</span> than that of the female. The bill, legs and feet are black. The eye is dark brown.</p>
<p>The head, throat and mantle of the male are bright metallic green. The rest of the upper parts are olive green. The upper breast is metallic violet and the lower breast is bright orange, fading to paler orange and yellow on the belly. The tail is long and blackish, with elongated central tail <span>feathers</span>, which extend some way, belong the other feathers.</p>
<p>The female has olive-greenish grey upperparts and olive yellowish underparts, paler on the belly. The wings and tail is blackish. The juvenile resembles the female.</p>
<p>The <span>call</span> is a twangy, weak <i>ssharaynk</i> or <i>sskrang</i>, often repeated several times.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Obviously due to its restricted range within <span>fynbos</span> this sunbird is associated with <span>Ericas</span>, from which it takes <span>nectar</span>, <span>insects</span> (often taken in flight) and <span>spiders</span>. It breeds when the <span>heath</span> flowers, typically in May. The male defends its territory aggressively, attacking and chasing intruders.</p>
<p>This tame species is a common breeder across its limited range, and is an altitudinal <span>migrant</span>, moving to higher altitudes during the southern summer in search of flowers. It is gregarious when not breeding, forming flocks of up to 100 birds.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>The Orange-breasted Sunbird subsists on flower nectar, insects and spiders.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>The Orange-breasted Sunbird breeds from February to November (Mainly in May - August) The <span>nest</span> is an oval of rootlets, fine leafy twigs and grass, bound together with <span>spider</span> webs and lined with brown protea fluff. It has a side top entrance, but does not have a covered porch.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>This species is not seriously threatened, although it may be adversely affected by urbanisation, habitat conversion to agriculture, and fynbos fires.</p>
