<p>The <b>Levant sparrowhawk</b> (<i>Accipiter brevipes</i>) is a small <span>bird of prey</span> in the family <span>Accipitridae</span> which also includes many other diurnal <span>raptors</span> such as <span>eagles</span>, <span>buzzards</span> and <span>harriers</span>.</p>
<p>It breeds in forests from <span>Greece</span> and the <span>Balkans</span> east to southern <span>Russia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering from <span>Egypt</span> across to southwestern <span>Iran</span>. It will migrate in large flocks, unlike the more widespread <span>Eurasian sparrowhawk</span>.</p>
<p>The Levant sparrowhawk nests in trees, building a new nest, lined with green leaves, each year. The normal clutch is 3-5 eggs. It hunts small <span>birds</span>, <span>insects</span> and <span>lizards</span> in woodland, relying on surprise as it flies from a perch to catch its prey unaware.</p>
<p>This bird is a small raptor with short broad wings and a longish tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. It is similar to the Eurasian Sparrowhawk, but its shorter tail and more pointed wings give it a more <span>falcon-like</span> appearance.</p>
<p>Levant sparrowhawk is 30&#x2013;37&#xA0;cm long with a 63&#x2013;76&#xA0;cm wingspan. The female is larger than the male, but the difference is not as marked as with Eurasian sparrowhawk. The adult male is blue-grey above, with dark wingtips, and barred reddish below.</p>
<p>The adult female is slate-grey above with darkish wingtips. She is barred reddish brown below, and may show a dark throat line. The juvenile is dark brown above and has dark-streaked underparts. It shows a dark throat line. The flight of this hawk is a characteristic <i>flap &#x2013; flap &#x2013; glide</i>.</p>
<p>The call is a sharp <i>kee-wick</i>.</p>
