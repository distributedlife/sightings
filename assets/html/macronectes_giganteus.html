<p>The <b>southern giant petrel</b> (<i>Macronectes giganteus</i>), also known as the <b>Antarctic giant petrel</b>, <b>giant fulmar</b>, <b>stinker</b>, and <b>stinkpot</b>, is a large <span>seabird</span> of the southern oceans. Its distribution overlaps broadly with the similar <span>northern giant petrel</span>, though it overall is centered slightly further south. Adults of the two species can be separated by the colour of their bill-tip: greenish in the southern and reddish in the northern.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The southern giant petrel is one of two members of the <span>genus</span> <span>Macronectes</span>, which in turn, along with 14 other genera, comprise the <span>Procellariidae</span> <span>family</span>. Macronectes, also referred to as the giant petrels, along with the genus <i><span>Fulmarus</span></i>, <span>Cape petrel</span>, <span>Antarctic petrel</span>, and the <span>snow petrel</span> form a sub-family within the larger family.</p>
<p>The southern giant petrel was first described as <i>Macronectes giganteus</i> by <span>Johann Friedrich Gmelin</span>, in 1789, based on a specimen from <span>Staten Island</span> off <span>Tierra del Fuego</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Macronectes giganteus</i> can be broken down as <i>makros</i> a <span>Greek</span> word meaning "long" or "large" and <i>n&#x113;kt&#x113;s</i> meaning "swimmer", and <i>giganteus</i> from the <span>Latin</span> for "gigantic". <i>Southern giant petrel</i> starts with <i>southern</i> referring to their habitat being further south than their counterpart the <span>northern giant petrel</span>, and <i>petrel</i> refers to <span>St. Peter</span> and from the story of him walking on water, which refers to how they run on top of the water as they are getting airborne. They were also called <i>fulmar</i>, which comes from <i>full</i> an <span>Old Norse</span> word meaning "foul", and <i>mar</i> meaning "gull". They resemble <span>seagulls</span> and they have the ability of spitting a foul smelling concoction at <span>predators</span>.</p>

<p>This petrel is the largest of the Procellariidae and measures 86&#x2013;99&#xA0;cm (34&#x2013;39&#xA0;in) with a wingspan of 185&#x2013;205&#xA0;cm (73&#x2013;81&#xA0;in). The male weighs approximately 5&#xA0;kg (11&#xA0;lb) and the female 3&#x2013;8&#xA0;kg (6.6&#x2013;17.6&#xA0;lb). They have a very large yellow <span>bill</span>, with a green tip and greyish-brown legs. There are two different <span>morphs</span>, the dark which resembles the <span>northern giant petrel</span>, and the more distinct light morph. On the dark morph the upper breast, head and neck are light with the remainder of its <span>plumage</span> being mottled brown. The leading edge of its wing is lighter as is the base of the inner <span>primaries</span>, on the underside. The light morph is rarer and very distinct with only slight black speckles on an otherwise all white look. As juveniles, the dark morph starts off more sooty brown and pales as it ages. Both giant petrels have strong legs and can move around on land effectively. Finally, when in flight this <span>species</span> has a somewhat <span>hunchbacked</span> appearance.</p>
<p>It, like all members of the <span>Procellariiformes</span> have certain features that set them apart from other birds. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the petrels are on the top of the bill. The bills of all Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as used as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe; it excretes a concentrated saline solution from the nostrils.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The southern giant petrel achieves <span>sexual maturity</span> at six or seven years of age; however the average age of first breeding is ten years. Its breeding season begins in October. Its <span>nest</span> is a mound of <span>moss</span>, <span>grass</span>, and stones with a depression in the centre and is located on bare or grassy ground. They form loose <span>colonies</span> except in the <span>Falkland Islands</span> where the colonies are much larger. One <span>egg</span> is laid and is <span>incubated</span> for 55&#x2013;66 days. When the white chick is born it is <span>brooded</span> for two to three weeks and it <span>fledges</span> at 104&#x2013;132 days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>This petrel will feed on <span>krill</span>, <span>squid</span>, and <span>offal</span> in <span>coastal</span> and <span>pelagic</span> waters, and unlike most other <span>Procellariiformes</span>, this <span>bird</span> will eat <span>carrion</span> and even attack smaller <span>seabirds</span>. The males exclude females from the carcasses that they are feeding off of.</p>

<p>The range of this bird is quite large as it ranges from <span>Antarctica</span> to the <span>subtropics</span> of <span>Chile</span>, <span>Africa</span>, and <span>Australia</span>, and has an occurrence <span>range</span> of 36,000,000&#xA0;km (14,000,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). It <span>breeds</span> on numerous <span>islands</span> throughout the southern <span>oceans</span>. The islands with larger populations include the <span>Falkland Islands</span>, <span>South Georgia</span>, <span>South Orkney Islands</span>, <span>Staten Island</span>, <span>South Shetland</span>, <span>Heard Island</span>, <span>Macquarie Island</span>, the <span>Prince Edward Islands</span>, and the <span>Crozet Islands</span>. The other locations with small populations are the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, <span>Gough Island</span>, <span>Tristan da Cunha</span>, <span>Diego Ramirez</span>, <span>Isla Noir</span> as well as four locations on the <span>continent</span> of <span>Antarctica</span>, including <span>Terre Ad&#xE9;lie</span>, and small islands off the coast of <span>Argentina</span> near <span>Chubut</span> <span>province</span>. The colonies are visited year round.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>2009 was a good year for this species as it was upgraded to a status of <span>least concern</span> from <span>near threatened</span>, by the <span>IUCN</span>. This downgrade was due to a clearer picture and more accurate censuses. Overall population trends show that in the 1980s there were 38,000 pairs which dropped to 31,000 in the late 1990s followed by 46,800 presently. The <span>Falkland Islands</span> and most of the <span>South Georgia Archipelago</span> have shown increases from the 1980s to the present. <span>Terre Ad&#xE9;lie</span> has shown a drastic reduction as the count fell to 10&#x2014;15 pairs from 80 pairs in the 1980s. The official 10/3 generation trend is listed by <span>BirdLife International</span> at a 1%&#x2014;9% declinatation, but it is stated that this is a conservative number. They elaborate that a best case scenario puts it at a 17% increase and a worst-case scenario of a 7.2% reduction.</p>
<p>Major threats to the well-being of this species start with the typical accidental deaths caused by <span>longline fishing</span> as well as <span>trawl fishing</span> near the <span>Falkland Islands</span>. Between 2,000 and 4,000 were killed in 1997&#x2014;1998 due to illegal longline fishing. Also the number of <span>southern elephant seals</span>, which is an important source of food as <span>carrion</span>, has been shrinking. Human disturbances have also adversely affected this bird.</p>
<p>To assist in this bird's continued survival it was placed in <span>CMS Appendix II</span> and <span>ACAP Annex I</span>. Many of the islands that it breeds on are <span>nature reserves</span>, and <span>Gough Island</span> and <span>Macquarie Island</span> are <span>World Heritage Sites</span>. Monitoring is done on <span>South Georgia</span>, <span>Marion Island</span>, the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Terre Ad&#xE9;lie</span>, and <span>Macquarie Island</span>. <span>Gough Island</span> has had two censuses in the last decade.</p>
<p>Continued monitoring and surveys at major breeding sites have been proposed, as well as researching movement and <span>migration</span>. Finally, continued promotion of "best-practice mitigation measures" via existing methods outlined in <span>CCAMLR</span>, <span>CMS</span>, and <span>FAO</span>.</p>
