<p>The <b>bristle-thighed curlew</b> (<i>Numenius tahitiensis</i>) is a medium-sized <span>shorebird</span> that breeds in <span>Alaska</span> and winters on tropical <span>Pacific</span> islands. It has a long, decurved bill and bristled feathers at the base of the legs. Its length is about 40&#x2013;44&#xA0;cm and wingspan about 84&#xA0;cm (females averaging bigger than males). The size and shape are the same as the <span>whimbrel</span>'s, and the <span>plumage</span> is similar, spotted brown on their upper body with a light belly and rust-colored or buffy tail. The bigger buff spots on the upper body, unmarked light belly and barely marked flanks, tail color, and pale buffy-orange rump distinguish it from the <span>whimbrel</span>.</p>
<p>The population is estimated at 7,000.</p>
<p>Bristle-thighed curlews feed on a wide variety of vegetation such as <span>flowers</span> and berries and on insects, sea life, and other <span>bird's eggs</span>, which they break open with rocks &#x2014; the only tool use among shorebirds.</p>
<p>The bird is rarely seen near populated land masses, with only a handful of sightings in <span>Canada</span>, <span>California</span> and <span>Oregon</span>. It was first described scientifically during <span>James Cook</span>'s visits to <span>Tahiti</span> in the 18th century, but its nesting grounds were not identified until 1948.</p>
<p>Nesting grounds are on the lower <span>Yukon River</span> and <span>Seward Peninsula</span>, with the birds preferring low-lying <span>tundra</span> near the shoreline. <span>Nests</span> are built in ground depressions and lined with tundra moss. Eggs are greenish with brown spots, with four to a clutch and one brood per season. Incubation lasts 25 days, with both parents tending the nest and protecting the newly hatched chicks.</p>
<p>Adults leave their chicks at about five weeks of age to <span>migrate</span> south. The chicks continue to feed until they are able to make the journey. The first leg of the migration includes a nonstop 4,000&#xA0;km flight from Alaska to <span>Laysan</span>. They can make non-stop flights in excess of 6,000&#xA0;km.</p>
<p>Bristle-thighed curlews are unique among shorebirds in that they are flightless during <span>molt</span>. Also, their migration departures consist of small flocks and have no <span>diurnal</span> patterns.</p>
<p>Its winter habitat is tropical <span>Oceania</span>, and includes <span>Micronesia</span>, <span>Fiji</span>, <span>Tuvalu</span>, <span>Tonga</span>, <span>Hawaiian Islands</span>, <span>Samoa</span>, and <span>French Polynesia</span>. There is concern over encroachment and introduced <span>predators</span> in their winter habitat.</p>
