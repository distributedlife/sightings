<p>The <b>ginkgo-toothed beaked whale</b> (<i>Mesoplodon ginkgodens</i>) is a poorly known species of <span>whale</span> even for a <span>beaked whale</span>, and was named for the unusual shape of its dual teeth. It is a fairly typical-looking species, but is notable for the males not having any scarring.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_appearance">Physical appearance</span></h2>
<p>Ginkgo-toothed beaked whales are more robust than most <span>mesoplodonts</span>, but otherwise look fairly typical. Halfway through the jaw, there is a sharp curve up where the <span>ginkgo</span> leaf-shaped tooth is. Unlike other species such as <span>Blainville's beaked whale</span> and <span>Andrews' beaked whale</span>, the teeth do not arch over the rostrum. The beak itself is of a moderate length. The coloration is overall dark gray on males with light patches on the front half of the beak and around the head, and small white spots on the bottom of the tail, but the location may be variable. Females are a lighter gray and have countershading. Both genders reach 4.9 meters (16&#xA0;feet) in length. They are around 2.4 meters long (8&#xA0;feet) when born.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_and_distribution">Population and distribution</span></h2>
<p>This beaked whale has had fewer than 20 strandings off the coasts of <span>Japan</span>, <span>California</span>, the <span>Galapagos Islands</span>, <span>New South Wales</span>, <span>New Zealand</span>, <span>Sri Lanka</span>, the <span>Maldives</span>, and the Strait of Malacca. Its range is essentially tropical and temperate waters in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. There is no way to estimate the population.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The males probably do not engage in combat, and the species probably feeds on squid and fish. No other information is known.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The only observations of this species while alive have come from hunters off the coasts of Japan and <span>Taiwan</span>, who occasionally take an individual. They are also affected by drift gillnets. The ginkgo-toothed beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (<span>Pacific Cetaceans MOU</span>).</p>
