<p>The <b>Wood Warbler</b> (<i>Phylloscopus sibilatrix</i>) is a common and widespread <span>leaf warbler</span> which breeds throughout northern and temperate <span>Europe</span>, and just into the extreme west of <span>Asia</span> in the southern <span>Ural Mountains</span>. This <span>warbler</span> is strongly <span>migratory</span> and the entire population winters in tropical <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>This is a <span>bird</span> of open but shady mature woodlands, such as <span>beech</span> and <span>sessile oak</span>, with some sparse ground cover for nesting. The dome-shaped nest is built near the ground in low shrub. 6 or 7 eggs are laid in May; there may be a second brood. Like most <span>Old World</span> <span>warblers</span>, this small <span>passerine</span> is insectivorous.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Wood Warbler is 11&#x2013;12.5&#xA0;cm long, and a typical leaf warbler in appearance, green above and white below with a lemon-yellow breast. It can be distinguished from similar <span>species</span>, like the <span>Chiffchaff</span> <i>P. collybita</i> and the <span>Willow Warbler</span>, <i>P. trochilus</i> by its yellow supercilium, throat and upper breast, pale tertial edges, longer primary projection, and by its shorter but broader tail.</p>
<p>It is a summer visitor to the <span>United Kingdom</span>, seen from April until August. It has declined there in recent years; it is now very rare in <span>Ireland</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Songs">Songs</span></h2>
<p>It has two song types, often (but not always) given alternately; a high-pitched fluid metallic trill of increasing tempo <span class="unicode haudio" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span class="fn">&#xA0;<span>pit-pit-pitpitpitpt-t-t-ttt</span></span>&#xA0;<small class="metadata audiolinkinfo" style="cursor:help;">(<span>help</span>&#xB7;<span>info</span>)</small></span> lasting 2&#x2013;3 seconds, and a series of 3 to 5 descending piping notes of lower pitch <i>pi&#xFC;&#xFC;-pi&#xFC;&#xFC;-pi&#xFC;&#xFC;</i>. The contact call is a soft piping note, similar to the second song type, but shorter and given singly, "<i>pi&#xFC;</i>".</p>
