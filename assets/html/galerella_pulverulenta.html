<p>The <b>Cape gray mongoose</b> (<i>Galerella pulverulenta</i>), also called the <b>small gray mongoose</b>, is a <span>mongoose</span> <span>endemic</span> to <span>southern Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>It is a small species (55&#x2013;69&#xA0;cm long, weight range 0.5 &#x2013; 1.0&#xA0;kg). It is a dark grey colour with the tip of the tail being darker. The legs are a darker grey than the rest of the body. It has a typical elongated mongoose body-shape. The ears are small and rounded and situated on the sides of the head. The tail is long and bushy. The teeth show adaptations for both cutting and crushing.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet_and_behaviour">Diet and behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Cape grey mongoose feeds mostly on insects and small rodents, but will also eat <span>birds</span>, small <span>reptiles</span>, <span>amphibians</span>, other <span>invertebrates</span>, and <span>fruit</span>. They have been known to eat carrion and garbage as well.</p>
<p>It is predominantly insectivorous but also carnivorous. Insects and other <span>arthropoda</span> such as spiders are caught on the ground and then held down with the forefeet and eaten. Larger prey such as rodents are stalked and killed with a bite to the head. Large prey items are held down with the forefeet and then torn into bite size pieces with the teeth.</p>
<p>Small rodents, in particular <span>Otomys</span> and <span>Rhabdomys</span>, are the most important dietary component. Exceptionally, immature hares or the young of small antelope such as <span>Cape Grysbok</span> may be attacked.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>Until a few decades ago the species was thought to be endemic to the <span>Cape Province</span>, but it is now known to occur in much of the rest of South Africa and in the west, northwards to southern <span>Angola</span>. It is not yet clear how continuous the range is, nor how much of this wider presence is due to extension of its range. Its density in areas where the species is established, ranges from one mongoose per 60 hectares to one per two hectares.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>It inhabits macchia-type vegetation (<span>fynbos</span>), semi-desert scrub (<span>Karoo</span>), thicket and forest. However, it is not found in the <span>Grassland</span> biome. Often they live in close association with man, often under the floors of outbuildings, and even live successfully on the fringe of suburbia. When habituated to human presence they may tolerate close approach.</p>

<p>The Cape grey mongoose is diurnal. When not breeding it is solitary, but litter remains together in a family party at least until late adolescence. They live in overlapping home ranges of 5-68 ha, with the males having larger ranges than the females. However, it is not entirely clear whether this species is territorial or not, or whether it might be more social than generally believed. Poor diggers, they utilize piles of rocks, crevices, deserted burrows and hollows in tree trunks for shelter when there is not sufficient bush cover. They are often spotted by humans when they cross roads.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>Litters of 1 &#x2013; 3 young are born from August to December and hidden in burrows, rock crevices or tree hollows. At birth the pups are fully furred, but their eyes and ears are closed, opening after about a fortnight. The young remain in the breeding burrow until they are fully weaned, and leave when they are capable of independence.</p>
