<p>The <b>African brush-tailed porcupine</b> (<i>Atherurus africanus</i>) is a species of <span>rat</span>-like <span>Old World porcupines</span> called "<span>brush-tailed porcupines</span>". The brush-tailed porcupines live in forests, usually at high elevations. They are <span>nocturnal</span> and during the day they sleep in <span>caves</span> and burrows. The brush-tailed porcupine is one of the biggest <span>rodents</span> in <span>Africa</span>, with a body length of 36&#x2013;60 cm (14&#x2013;24 in), discounting a tail of about 10&#x2013;26 cm (4&#x2013;10 in) and weigh as much as 2.9 kg (6.4 lb). It has an elongated rat-like face and body and short legs, tipped with clawed and webbed feet. Unlike most other porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine has lighter and smaller quills. On the tail, these quills are thinner and brush-like. These can make noise when rattled. Brush-tailed porcupines live in small family groups of about eight members. Different family groups can share resources. When attacked by a <span>predator</span>, the porcupine raises its quills so it looks twice its size, rattles its tail quills, and stomps its feet. As with all porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine backs into the attacker and inflicts damage with its quills.</p>
<p>The brush-tailed porcupine is mostly herbivorous. When alone eating, the porcupines can be quite nervous. During the breeding season, males and females form pair bonds to get acquainted. The African brush-tailed porcupine has a long pregnancy compared to other rodents: 110 days at the longest. The young are born well-developed or <span>precocial</span>. Porcupines reach maturity at two years of age.</p>
<p>The meat of the African brush-tailed porcupines is popular and is consumed in large quantities.</p>
