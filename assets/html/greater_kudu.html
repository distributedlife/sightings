<p>The <b>greater kudu</b> (<i>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</i>) is a <span>woodland</span> <span>antelope</span> found throughout <span>eastern</span> and <span>southern</span> <span>Africa</span>. Despite occupying such widespread <span>territory</span>, they are sparsely populated in most areas, due to a declining <span>habitat</span>, <span>deforestation</span> and <span>poaching</span>. The greater kudu is one of two species commonly known as <span>kudu</span>, the other being the <span>lesser kudu</span>, <i>Tragelaphus imberbis</i>.</p>

Anterior view of a male</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Greater kudus have a narrow <span>body</span> with long <span>legs</span>, and their <span>coats</span> can range from brown/bluish-grey to reddish-brown. They possess between 4&#x2013;12 vertical white stripes along their <span>torso</span>. The <span>head</span> tends to be darker in colour than the rest of the body, and exhibits a small white <span>chevron</span> which runs between the <span>eyes</span>.</p>
<p>Male greater kudus tend to be much larger than the females, and vocalize much more, utilizing low <span>grunts</span>, clucks, <span>humming</span>, and gasping. The males also have large <span>manes</span> running along their <span>throats</span>, and large <span>horns</span> with two and a half twists, which, were they to be straightened, would reach an average length of 120&#xA0;cm (47&#xA0;in), with the record being 187.64&#xA0;cm (73.87&#xA0;in). They diverge slightly as they slant back from the head. The horns do not begin to grow until the male is between the <span>age</span> of 6&#x2013;12 months, twisting once at around 2 years of age, and not reaching the full two and a half twists until they are 6 years old; occasionally they may even have 3 full turns.</p>
<p>This is one of the largest species of antelope. Males weigh 190&#x2013;270&#xA0;kg (420&#x2013;600&#xA0;lb), with a maximum of 315&#xA0;kg (694&#xA0;lb), and stand up to 160&#xA0;cm (63&#xA0;in) tall at the shoulder. The ears of the greater kudu are large and round. Females weigh 120&#x2013;210&#xA0;kg (260&#x2013;460&#xA0;lb) and stand as little as 100&#xA0;cm (39&#xA0;in) tall at the shoulder; they are hornless, without a beard or nose markings. The head-and-body length is 185&#x2013;245&#xA0;cm (6.07&#x2013;8.04&#xA0;ft), to which the tail may add a further 30&#x2013;55&#xA0;cm (12&#x2013;22&#xA0;in).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h2>
<p>Formerly four <span>subspecies</span> have been described, but recently only one to three subspecies have been accepted based on colour, number of stripes and horn length:</p>

<p>This classification was supported by the genetic difference of one specimen of northern Kenya (<i>T. s. chora</i>) in comparison with several samples from the southern part of the range between Tanzania and Zimbabwe (<i>T. s. strepsiceros</i>). No specimen of the northwestern population, which may represent a third subspecies (<i>T. s. cottoni</i>) was tested within this study.</p>
<p>In Groves and Grubbs book <i>Ungulate Taxonomy</i>, a recent taxonomic revision was made which evaluated all species and subspecies of Kudu and other ungulates. This review split the genus <i><span>Tragelaphus</span></i> into 4 separate genera, <i>Tragelaphus</i> (<span>Bushbuck</span>, <span>Sitatunga</span>, <span>Bongo</span>, and the Gedemsa or <span>Mountain Nyala</span>), <i><span>Nyala</span></i> (the Nyala), <i>Ammelaphus</i> (<span>Lesser Kudu</span>), and <i>Strepsiceros</i> (Greater Kudu) and there close relative <i><span>Taurotragus</span></i> (Elands). The Greater Kudu was split into four species based on genetic evidence and morphological features (ex horn structure and coat color). Each species was based on a different subspecies, <i>Strepsiceros strepsiceros</i> (Cape Kudu), <i>Strepsiceros chora</i> (Northern Kudu), <i>Strepsiceros cottoni</i> (Western Kudu), and <i>Strepsiceros zambesiensis</i> (Zambezi Kudu) which is not commonly accepted even as a subspecies. The Cape Kudu is found in South Central South Africa, the Zambezi Kudu (closely related to the Cape Kudu) is found from Tanzania South to North and West South Africa, Namibia, and Angola through Zambia, Mozambique, and East DR Congo, the Northern Kudu is found in East Sudan South through Ethiopia and Kenya to the Tanzanian border, and the Western Kudu found in Southeastern Chad, West Sudan, and North Central African Republic. Although this alternative taxonomy is not commonly accepted, it was accepted in the <span>Handbook of the Mammals of the World</span>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <span>range</span> of the greater kudu extends from the east in <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Eritrea</span> and <span>Kenya</span> into the south where they are found in <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Angola</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>South Africa</span>. They have also been introduced in small numbers into <span>New Mexico</span>, but were never released into the wild. Their habitat includes thick <span>bushveld</span>, rocky <span>hillsides</span>, dry <span>riverbeds</span> and anywhere with a constant supply of <span>water</span>. They will occasionally venture onto plains only if there is a large abundance of bushes, but normally avoid such open areas to avoid becoming an easy target for their predators. Their diet consists of <span>leaves</span>, <span>grass</span>, <span>shoots</span> and occasionally <span>tubers</span>, <span>roots</span> and <span>fruit</span> (they are especially fond of <span>oranges</span> and <span>tangerines</span>).</p>

Kudus at waterhole</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the day, Greater kudus normally cease to be active and instead seek cover under <span>woodland</span>, especially during hot days. They feed and drink in the early <span>morning</span> and late <span>afternoon</span>, acquiring water from <span>waterholes</span> or roots and <span>bulbs</span> which have a high <span>water content</span>. Although they tend to stay in one area, the greater kudu may search over a large distance for water in times of <span>drought</span>, in southern Namibia where water is relatively scarce they have been known to travel extremely long distances in very short periods of time.</p>
<p><span>Predators</span> of the greater kudu generally consist of <span>lions</span>, <span>leopards</span>, <span>hyenas</span>, and <span>hunting dogs</span>. Although <span>cheetahs</span> also prey on greater kudus, they are unable to bring down a mature male, so usually go for the more vulnerable females and <span>offspring</span>. When a <span>herd</span> is threatened by predators, an adult (usually female) will issue a bark to alert the rest of the herd. Despite being very nimble over rocky hillsides and mountains, the greater kudu is not fast enough (and nor does it have enough <span>stamina</span>) to escape its main predators over open terrain, so instead relies on leaping over shrubs and small trees to shake off pursuers.</p>

Herd of kudu</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Female greater kudus live in small herds of six to twenty <span>individuals</span> along with their <span>calves</span>, though males tend to be mainly <span>solitary</span>, they sometimes form bachelor herds that consist of 4 to 8 young males (sometimes with an older bull as well). Rarely will a herd reach a size of forty individuals, partly because of the selective nature of their <span>diet</span> which would make <span>foraging</span> for food difficult in large groups. A herd's area can encompass 800 to 1,500 acres (6.1&#xA0;km), and spend an average of 54% of the day foraging for <span>food</span>..</p>
<p>Fully mature males will often <span>fight</span> other males by interlocking their <span>horns</span> with the other until one of them admits defeat and gives in. In rare circumstances this can sometimes result in both males being unable to free themselves from the other's horns, usually resulting in the <span>death</span> of both animals. Females may sometimes ward off males by <span>biting</span> them, due to their lack of horns.</p>

Kudu calf</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Greater kudus reach <span>sexual maturity</span> between 1&#x2013;3 years of <span>age</span>. The <span>mating season</span> occurs at the end of the <span>rainy season</span>, which can fluctuate slightly according to the <span>region</span> and <span>climate</span>. Before <span>mating</span>, there is a <span>courtship</span> <span>ritual</span> which consists of the <span>male</span> standing in front of the <span>female</span> and often engaging in a neck wrestle. The male then trails the female while issuing a <span>low pitched</span> call until the female allows him to <span>copulate</span> with her. <span>Gestation</span> takes around 240 days (or eight <span>months</span>). <span>Calving</span> generally starts between February and March, when the <span>grass</span> tends to be at its highest.</p>
<p>Greater kudus tend to bear one <span>calf</span>, although occasionally there may be two. To begin with, the calf will wait for the <span>mother</span> to <span>feed</span> it, but later it will become more demanding in its search for <span>milk</span>, and after a few months even <span>aggressive</span>. For the first two weeks of a calf's <span>life</span> they hide where <span>predators</span> cannot find them. For four to five <span>weeks</span> after that they roam with the herd only during day. Males will become <span>self-sufficient</span> at 6 months old. Females become self-sufficient at around 1 to 2 years old. Greater kudus may live up to 20 years of age when kept in <span>captivity</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_interaction">Human interaction</span></h2>
<p>Greater kudus have both benefited and suffered from interaction with <span>humans</span>; they are a target for <span>poachers</span>. They also are very evasive, using tactics of running short distances and hiding instead of simply running away which other African antelope commonly do. Humans have also destroyed <span>woodland</span> cover which they use for their <span>habitat</span>. However, <span>wells</span> and <span>irrigation</span> set up by humans has also allowed the greater kudus to occupy <span>territory</span> which would have been too devoid of <span>water</span> for them previously.</p>
<p>The horns of greater kudus are commonly used to make <span>Shofars</span>, a Jewish ritual horn blown at <span>Rosh Hashanah</span>.</p>
