<p>The <b>Golden Pipit</b> (<i>Tmetothylacus tenellus</i>) is a distinctive <span>pipit</span> of dry country <span>grassland</span>, <span>savanna</span> and <span>shrubland</span> in eastern Africa. It is native to <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span> and <span>Uganda</span>, and has occurred as a vagrant to <span>Oman</span>, <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span>.</p>
<p>The adult male, unlike most pipits, is very easy to identify. It is yellow below and yellow in the wings. From the front the yellow throat and breast with the dark band does resemble the <span>Yellow-throated Longclaw</span> or <span>Pangani Longclaw</span>, but neither have yellow wings (very obvious in flight) and both have a black line in the face. The female Golden Pipit is a fairly typical brown pipit but has a yellow underside to the wing. It is gold in colour.</p>
