<p>The <b>puku</b> (<i><b>Kobus vardonii</b></i>) is an medium-sized <span>antelope</span> found in wet <span>grasslands</span> in southern <span>Democratic Republic of Congo</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and <span>Zambia</span>. Nearly one-third of their species isfound in <span>protected areas</span>, <span>zoos</span>, and <span>national parks</span> due to their diminishing <span>habitat</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Puku stand about 80&#xA0;cm (31&#xA0;in) at the shoulder and weigh from 70 to 80&#xA0;kg (150 to 180&#xA0;lb). The puku is sandy brown in colour, with the underbelly a slightly lighter brown. The coat is rougher than the similar-sized <span>southern reedbuck</span>, <span>lechwe</span> or <span>impala</span>, or the smaller <span>oribi</span>. Males have 50-cm-long, ridge-structured horns which are very vaguely <span>lyre</span>-shaped.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>Puku are found almost exclusively in <span>marshy</span> grassland and <span>dambos</span> of the <span>Kilombero Valley</span> of Tanzania, where they eat <span>grasses</span>. Puku are <span>crepuscular</span>, active in the early morning and late afternoon. When scared, puku repeat a shrill whistle sound. Females gather in <span>herds</span> of up to 20 individuals. During the rainy season, many herds will come together for added safety, typically reaching around 50 females. Males hold <span>territories</span> and attempt to persuade herds of females to stay within their territories for as long as possible. In the wet season, due to large floods in their habitat they migrate to a high elevation and in dry seasons remain near water.</p>
