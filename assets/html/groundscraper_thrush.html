<p>The <b>groundscraper thrush</b> (<i>Psophocichla litsitsirupa</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of southern and eastern <span>Africa</span> belonging to the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae. It is the <span>only member</span> of the genus <i><b>Psophocichla</b></i>.</p>
<p>It is 22&#x2013;24&#xA0;cm long with an erect posture, short tail, heavy <span>bill</span> and fairly long legs. The upperparts are plain grey-brown with a chestnut wing-panel. The underparts are white with black spots and the face is white with bold black markings. The underwing has a black and white pattern which is visible during the undulating flight. The bird has a slow whistled <span>song</span> and a clicking call.</p>
<p>There are four <span>subspecies</span>: <i>P. l. litsitsirupa</i> is the most southerly form, occurring from <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>Mozambique</span> south to northern and eastern parts of <span>South Africa</span>. <i>P. l. pauciguttata</i> is found in southern <span>Angola</span>, northern Namibia and north-west Botswana while <i>P. l. stierlingae</i> occurs in a band from northern Angola across to western <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Malawi</span> and north-west Mozambique. The range of <i>P. l. simensis</i> is separated from the others; it inhabits the highlands of <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Eritrea</span>. The species is found in <span>savannas</span>, <span>grassland</span> and open <span>woodland</span>. It can be tame and will forage in parks, <span>gardens</span> and around picnic sites.</p>
<p>The cup-shaped <span>nest</span> is built using vegetation and spider-webs and is lined with <span>feathers</span> or <span>leaves</span>. Three or four <span>eggs</span> are laid and are <span>incubated</span> for 14 to 15 days. They are bluish with lilac and red-brown spots and blotches.</p>
