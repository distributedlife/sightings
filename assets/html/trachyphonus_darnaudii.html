<p><b>D'Arnaud's barbet</b> (<i>Trachyphonus darnaudii</i>) is an <span>African barbet</span>. Barbets and <span>toucans</span> are a group of <span>near passerine</span> birds with a worldwide tropical distribution. The barbets get their name from the bristles which fringe their heavy bills. Four geographical races (<i>darnaudii</i>, <i>b&#xF6;hmi</i>, <i>emini</i> and <i>usambiro</i>) have been recorded.</p>
<p>D'Arnaud's barbet is a small East African bird that feeds on insects, fruits, and seeds. It grows to about eight inches, and is equally at home in trees or on the ground. A vertical tunnel two to three feet into the ground with a sideways and upward turn leads to the nest chamber. In a striking dance the male and female face each on nearby twigs and twitch, bob and sing like mechanical toys.</p>
