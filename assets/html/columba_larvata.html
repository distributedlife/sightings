<p>The <b>Lemon Dove</b> or <b>Cinnamon Dove</b> (<i>Columba larvata</i>) is a <span>bird</span> <span>species</span> in the <span>pigeon</span> <span>family</span> (Columbidae). It differs from the other <span>African</span> pigeons of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Columba</span></i> by its terrestrial habits and the white face and forehead of adult males; it is therefore sometimes separated in the genus <i>Aplopelia</i>. Some treat the <span>Gulf of Guinea</span> <span>populations</span> (<b>S&#xE3;o Tom&#xE9; Lemon-dove</b>) as a separate species <i>C. simplex</i> (or <i>A. simplex</i>), others as <span>subspecies</span> of <i>C. larvata</i>. In the latter case, the species as a whole may be called simply <b>Lemon-dove</b>, and if <i><b>Aplopelia</b></i> is considered a valid genus it would then be <span>monotypic</span>.</p>

<p>The Lemon Dove is fairly small, measuring 24&#x2013;30&#xA0;cm (9.4&#x2013;11.8&#xA0;in) in length and weighing 81.7&#x2013;150&#xA0;g (2.88&#x2013;5.29&#xA0;oz). Adult males have a plumage that is dark brown above, glossed green on sides of neck, and cinnamon brown below. As noted, they have conspicuous white face markings. The feet, <span>iris</span> and orbital skin are red, the <span>bill</span> is black. Females and young males are generally similar, with a lighter brown plumage and dull grey facial markings. The males of western African <span>subspecies</span> have a dark grey plumage.</p>
<p>The Lemon Dove is distributed in <span>montane forests</span> of <span>Africa</span>, ranging for example from some 100 meters to 3,000 meters <span>ASL</span> in eastern Africa. The diet consists mainly of various small fruits, seeds, molluscs and insects. The female usually lays two creamy white eggs.</p>
<p>Widespread throughout its range, the Lemon Dove is evaluated as a Species of <span>Least Concern</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species. Nonetheless, it seems to be declining in some parts of its range; in <span>Tanzania</span> for example it is not rare above 1.300 meters ASL in the <span>Nguu North Forest Reserve</span>, but not at all common in some lower-lying <span>habitat</span>. It is nearly absent from the southeast of that country.</p>
