<p>The <b>common buzzard</b> (<i>Buteo buteo</i>) is a medium-to-large <span>bird of prey</span>, whose range covers most of Europe and extends into Asia. It is usually resident year-round, except in the coldest parts of its range, and in the case of one subspecies.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The common buzzard measures between 40 and 58&#xA0;cm (16 and 23&#xA0;in) in length with a 109&#x2013;136&#xA0;cm (43&#x2013;54&#xA0;in) wingspan and a body mass of 427&#x2013;1,364&#xA0;g (0.941&#x2013;3.007&#xA0;lb), making it a medium-sized <span>raptor</span>.</p>
<p>This broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar <span>rough-legged buzzard</span> (<i>Buteo lagopus</i>) and the only distantly related <span>European honey buzzard</span> (<i>Pernis apivorus</i>), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from <span>northern goshawks</span>. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systematics">Systematics</span></h2>
<p>The common buzzard was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Falco buteo</i>. Buzzard subspecies fall into two groups. The western <i>Buteo</i> group is mainly resident or short-distance <span>migrants</span>. They are:</p>

<p>The eastern <i>vulpinus</i> group includes</p>

<p>Two resident forms on islands close to <span>Africa</span> are often assigned to the first group, but appear to be distinct <span>species</span>, more closely related to the African <span>long-legged buzzard</span>, based on <span>biogeography</span> and preliminary <span>mtDNA</span> <span>cytochrome b</span> <span>sequence</span> data (Clouet &amp; Wink 2000):</p>

In flight, Devon, England. There are around 40,000 <span>breeding pairs</span> in the United Kingdom</div>

<p>The common buzzard breeds in <span>woodlands</span>, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small <span>mammals</span>, and will come to <span>carrion</span>. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.</p>
<p>Buzzards do not normally form <span>flocks</span>, but several may be seen together on <span>migration</span> or in good habitat. The <span>Victorian</span> writer on <span>Dartmoor</span>, <span>William Crossing</span>, noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately 30 metres apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.</p>
<p>The call is a plaintive <i>peea-ay</i>, similar to a cat's <span>meow</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Steppe_buzzard">Steppe buzzard</span></h2>
<p>The steppe buzzard, <i>B. (b.) vulpinus</i> breeds from east Europe eastward to the Far East, excluding Japan. It is a long-distance <span>migrant</span>, excepting some north <span>Himalayan</span> birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.</p>
<p>The steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, <i>B. vulpinus</i>. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller (45&#x2013;50&#xA0;cm long), longer winged and longer tailed. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (<i>vulpes</i> is Latin for "fox"), and a dark grey form.</p>
<p>The tail of <i>vulpinus</i> is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American <span>red-tailed hawk</span>. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in <i>B. b. buteo</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Forest_buzzard">Forest buzzard</span></h2>
<p>The forest buzzard, <i>B. (b.) trizonatus</i>, is another form sometimes upgraded to a full species, though most recent authorities have placed it as a subspecies of another species, the <span>mountain buzzard</span>, <i>B. oreophilus</i>. This is a resident breeding species in woodlands in southern and eastern South Africa.</p>
<p>It is very similar to the abundant summer migrant steppe buzzard, but the adult can be distinguished with a good view by its whiter underparts and unbarred flanks. The juvenile differs from the same-age steppe buzzard by its white front and tear-shaped flank streaks.</p>
<p>The forest buzzard, as its name implies, inhabits evergreen woodlands, including introduced <span>eucalyptus</span> and <span>pines</span>, whereas the steppe buzzard prefers more open habitats. However, habitat alone is not a good indicator for these forms.</p>
