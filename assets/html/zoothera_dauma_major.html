<p>The <b>Amami thrush</b>, (<i>Zoothera dauma major</i>), is a member of the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae. It is endemic to the islands of <span>Amami &#x14C;shima</span> and Kakeroma island in the northern <span>Nansei Islands</span> of <span>Japan</span>.</p>
<p>This large, heavily patterned thrush is similar in appearance to the <span>scaly thrush</span>, to which it is usually considered a subspecies. It has warm olive-brown to buff upperparts and whitish underparts with heavy black scaling. It has twelve tail <span>feathers</span>. The scaly thrush is smaller and has fourteen tail feathers. It has a cheerful song similar to the <span>Siberian thrush</span>. Among thrushes, only the <span>blue whistling thrush</span> typically attains a larger size. The Amami thrush ranges in length from 29 to 31&#xA0;cm (11 to 12&#xA0;in) and weighs approximately 172&#xA0;g (6.1&#xA0;oz). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 16.4 to 17.3&#xA0;cm (6.5 to 6.8&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 3.1 to 3.3&#xA0;cm (1.2 to 1.3&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 4.1 to 4.5&#xA0;cm (1.6 to 1.8&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>Its breeding <span>habitat</span> is mature subtropical broadleaved <span>evergreen</span> forest around humid valleys. Its diet includes <span>invertebrates</span> and <span>fruit</span>. It breeds in May and June, laying 3-4 <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>This bird is critically <span>endangered</span> due to forest clearance. The current population is estimated at less than sixty. Areas of forest have been protected by the government primarily for the conservation of this species and the <span>Lidth's jay</span>.</p>
<p>The breeding population is estimated by Amami Ornithologists' Club (NPO, Japan) all over the island every late March since 1999. The total number of singing birds, which may be territory holders, counted were more than 162 in 2006.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomic_note">Taxonomic note</span></h2>
<p>Since 2006 this taxon is no longer recognised by <span>BirdLife International</span>. It has been lumped into <i><span>Zoothera dauma</span></i> following Collar (2004). As a subspecies its conservation status is no longer classified.</p>
