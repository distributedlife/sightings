</div>
<p>The <b>osprey</b> (<i>Pandion haliaetus</i>), sometimes known as the <b>sea hawk</b>, <b>fish eagle,</b> <b>river hawk</b> or <b>fish hawk</b>, is a <span>diurnal</span>, <span>fish-eating</span> <span>bird of prey</span>. It is a large <span>raptor</span>, reaching more than 60&#xA0;cm (24&#xA0;in) in length and 180&#xA0;cm (71&#xA0;in) across the wings. It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish on the head and underparts.</p>
<p>The osprey tolerates a wide variety of <span>habitats</span>, nesting in any location near a body of water providing an adequate food supply. It is found on all continents except Antarctica, although in South America it occurs only as a non-breeding <span>migrant</span>.</p>
<p>As its other common name suggests, the osprey's diet consists almost exclusively of fish. It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour to assist in hunting and catching <span>prey</span>. As a result of these unique characteristics, it has been given its own <span>taxonomic</span> <span>genus</span>, <i><b>Pandion</b></i> and <span>family</span>, <b>Pandionidae</b>. Four <span>subspecies</span> are usually recognized, one of which has recently been given full species status (see below). Despite its propensity to nest near water, the osprey is not classed as a <span>sea-eagle</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>The osprey was one of the many species described by <span>Carolus Linnaeus</span> in his 18th-century work, <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i>, and named as <i>Falco haliaeetus</i>. The genus, <i>Pandion</i>, is the sole member of the family of Pandionidae, and used to contain only one species, the osprey (<i>P. haliaetus</i>). The genus <i>Pandion</i> was described by the French zoologist <span>Marie Jules C&#xE9;sar Savigny</span> in 1809, and is taken from a mythical Greek king, Pandion.</p>
<p>The osprey differs in several respects from other <span>diurnal</span> birds of prey. Its toes are of equal length, its <span>tarsi</span> are <span>reticulate</span>, and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The osprey and owls are the only raptors whose outer toe is reversible, allowing them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish. It has always presented something of a riddle to taxonomists, but here it is treated as the sole <span>living member</span> of the family Pandionidae, and the family listed in its traditional place as part of the order <span>Falconiformes</span>. Other schemes place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family <span>Accipitridae</span>&#x2014;which itself can be regarded as making up the bulk of the order <span>Accipitriformes</span> or else be lumped with the <span>Falconidae</span> into <span>Falconiformes</span>. The <span>Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy</span> has placed it together with the other diurnal raptors in a greatly enlarged <span>Ciconiiformes</span>, but this results in an unnatural <span>paraphyletic</span> classification.</p>

<p>The osprey is unusual in that it is a single living species that occurs nearly worldwide. Even the few <span>subspecies</span> are not unequivocally separable. There are four generally recognised subspecies, although differences are small, and <span>ITIS</span> only lists the first two.</p>

<p>Recently, <i>P. h. cristatus</i> has been given full species status as eastern osprey.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fossil_record">Fossil record</span></h3>
<p>To date there have been two <span>extinct</span> species named from the fossil record. <i><span>Pandion homalopteron</span></i> was named by <span>Stuart L. Warter</span> in 1976 from fossils of <span>Middle Miocene</span>, <span>Barstovian</span> age, found in marine deposits in the southern part of the U.S. state of <span>California</span>. The second named species <i><span>Pandion lovensis</span></i>, was described in 1985 by <span>Jonathan J. Becker</span> from fossils found in the U.S. state of <span>Florida</span> and dating to the <span>latest Clarendonian</span> and possibly representing a separate lineage from that of <i>P. homalopteron</i> and <i>P. haliaetus</i>. A number of claw fossils have been recovered from Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments in Florida and <span>South Carolina</span>, USA. The oldest recognized Pandionidae family fossils have been recovered from the Oligocene age <span>Jebel Qatrani Formation</span>, of <span>Faiyum</span>, <span>Egypt</span>. However they are not complete enough to assign to a specific genus. Another Pandionidae claw fossil was recovered from <span>Early Oligocene</span> deposits in the <span>Mainz</span> basin, <span>Germany</span>, and was described in 2006 by <span>Gerald Mayr</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h3>
<p>The genus name <i>Pandion</i> is after the mythical Greek king <span>Pandion</span> of <span>Athens</span> and grandfather of <span>Theseus</span>, who was transformed into an eagle. The specific epithet <i>haliaetus</i> is derived from the <span>Greek</span> <span lang="grc">&#x1F01;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3AC;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> "<span>sea eagle</span>/osprey".</p>
<p>The origins of <i>osprey</i> are obscure; the word itself was first recorded around 1460, derived via the <span>Anglo-French</span> <i>ospriet</i> and the <span>Medieval Latin</span> <i>avis prede</i> "bird of prey," from the <span>Latin</span> <i>avis praed&#xE6;</i> though the <span>Oxford English Dictionary</span> notes a connection with the <span>Latin</span> <i>ossifraga</i> or "bone breaker" of <span>Pliny the Elder</span>. However, this term referred to the <span>Lammergeier</span>.</p>

<p>The osprey is 0.9&#x2013;2.1&#xA0;kg (2.0&#x2013;4.6&#xA0;lb) in weight and 50&#x2013;66&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;26&#xA0;in) in length with a 127&#x2013;180&#xA0;cm (50&#x2013;71&#xA0;in) wingspan. The subspecies are fairly close in size, with the nominate subspecies averaging 1.53&#xA0;kg (3.4&#xA0;lb), <i>P. h. carolinensis</i> averaging 1.7&#xA0;kg (3.7&#xA0;lb) and <i>P. h. cristatus</i> averaging 1.25&#xA0;kg (2.8&#xA0;lb). The wing chord measures 38 to 52&#xA0;cm (15 to 20&#xA0;in), the tail measures 16.5 to 24&#xA0;cm (6.5 to 9.4&#xA0;in) and the tarsus is 5.2&#x2013;6.6&#xA0;cm (2.0&#x2013;2.6&#xA0;in). The upperparts are a deep, glossy brown, while the breast is white and sometimes streaked with brown, and the underparts are pure white. The head is white with a dark mask across the eyes, reaching to the sides of the neck. The irises of the eyes are golden to brown, and the transparent nictitating membrane is pale blue. The bill is black, with a blue <span>cere</span>, and the feet are white with black talons. A short tail and long, narrow wings with four long, finger-like feathers, and a shorter fifth, give it a very distinctive appearance.</p>

In flight, over Lake Wylie, South Carolina</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sexes appear fairly similar, but the adult male can be distinguished from the female by its slimmer body and narrower wings. The breast band of the male is also weaker than that of the female, or is non-existent, and the underwing coverts of the male are more uniformly pale. It is straightforward to determine the sex in a breeding pair, but harder with individual birds.</p>
<p>The juvenile osprey may be identified by buff fringes to the plumage of the upperparts, a buff tone to the underparts, and streaked feathers on the head. During spring, barring on the underwings and flight feathers is a better indicator of a young bird, due to wear on the upperparts.</p>
<p>In flight, the osprey has arched wings and drooping "hands", giving it a <span>gull-like</span> appearance. The call is a series of sharp whistles, described as <i>cheep, cheep</i> or <i>yewk, yewk</i>. If disturbed by activity near the nest, the call is a frenzied <i>cheereek</i>! <span class="unicode haudio" style="white-space:nowrap;"><span class="fn">&#xA0;<span>Osprey&#xA0;call</span></span>&#xA0;<small class="metadata audiolinkinfo" style="cursor:help;">(<span>help</span>&#xB7;<span>info</span>)</small></span></p>

<div class="hatnote boilerplate seealso">See also: <span>Ospreys in Britain</span></div>
<p>The osprey is the second most widely distributed raptor species, after the <span>peregrine falcon</span>. It has a worldwide distribution and is found in temperate and tropical regions of all continents except <span>Antarctica</span>. In <span>North America</span> it breeds from <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Newfoundland</span> south to the <span>Gulf Coast</span> and <span>Florida</span>, wintering further south from the southern <span>United States</span> through to <span>Argentina</span>. It is found in summer throughout Europe north into <span>Ireland</span>, <span>Scandinavia</span>, <span>Finland</span> and <span>Scotland</span>, <span>England</span>, and <span>Wales</span> though not Iceland, and winters in <span>North Africa</span>. In <span>Australia</span> it is mainly <span>sedentary</span> and found patchily around the coastline, though it is a non-breeding visitor to eastern <span>Victoria</span> and <span>Tasmania</span>. There is a 1,000&#xA0;km (620&#xA0;mi) gap, corresponding with the coast of the <span>Nullarbor Plain</span>, between its westernmost breeding site in <span>South Australia</span> and the nearest breeding sites to the west in <span>Western Australia</span>. In the islands of the <span>Pacific</span> it is found in the <span>Bismarck Islands</span>, <span>Solomon Islands</span> and <span>New Caledonia</span>, and <span>fossil</span> remains of adults and juveniles have been found in <span>Tonga</span>, where it probably was wiped out by arriving humans. It is possible it may once have ranged across <span>Vanuatu</span> and <span>Fiji</span> as well. It is an uncommon to fairly common winter visitor to all parts of <span>South Asia</span>, and <span>Southeast Asia</span> from <span>Myanmar</span> through to <span>Indochina</span> and southern <span>China</span>, <span>Indonesia</span>, <span>Malaysia</span> and the <span>Philippines</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour_and_ecology">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>
<p>Ospreys have been known to exhibit great joint flexibility. Their limbs (wings and legs) have adapted to have greater flexibility over time. An example of this is when flying towards bright lights (e.g., sun)&#x2014;they are able to bend the joint in their wing to shield their eyes from the light to aid safety while flying.</p>

Eating a fish</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fish make up 99% of the osprey's diet. It typically takes fish weighing 150&#x2013;300&#xA0;g (5.3&#x2013;10.6&#xA0;oz) and about 25&#x2013;35&#xA0;cm (9.8&#x2013;13.8&#xA0;in) in length, but the weight can range from 50 grams (1.8&#xA0;oz) to 2&#xA0;kg (4.4&#xA0;lb). Virtually any type of fish in that size range are taken.</p>
<p>Ospreys have vision that is well adapted to detecting underwater objects from the air. Prey is first sighted when the osprey is 10&#x2013;40&#xA0;m (33&#x2013;131&#xA0;ft) above the water, after which the bird hovers momentarily then plunges feet first into the water.</p>
<p>The osprey is particularly well adapted to this diet, with reversible outer toes, sharp <span>spicules</span> on the underside of the toes, closable nostrils to keep out water during dives, and backwards-facing scales on the talons which act as barbs to help hold its catch.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the osprey may prey on <span>rodents</span>, rabbits, hares, amphibians, other <span>birds</span>, and small <span>reptiles</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>The osprey breeds near freshwater lakes and rivers, and sometimes on coastal brackish waters. Rocky outcrops just offshore are used in <span>Rottnest Island</span> off the coast of <span>Western Australia</span>, where there are 14 or so similar nesting sites of which five to seven are used in any one year. Many are renovated each season, and some have been used for 70 years. The nest is a large heap of sticks, driftwood and seaweed built in forks of trees, rocky outcrops, utility poles, artificial platforms or offshore islets. Generally, ospreys reach sexual maturity and begin breeding around the age of three to four, though in some regions with high osprey densities, such as <span>Chesapeake Bay</span> in the <span>U.S.</span>, they may not start breeding until five to seven years old, and there may be a shortage of suitable tall structures. If there are no nesting sites available, young ospreys may be forced to delay breeding. To ease this problem, posts are sometimes erected to provide more sites suitable for nest building.</p>

Preparing to mate on the nest</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The platform design developed by one organization, <span>Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc.</span> has become the official design of the <span>State of New Jersey</span>, U.S.A. The platform plans and materials list, available online, have been utilized by people from a number of different geographical regions. <span>Osprey-watch.org</span> is the global site for mapping osprey nest locations and logging observations on reproductive success.</p>
<p>Ospreys usually mate for life. Rarely, <span>polyandry</span> has been recorded. The breeding season varies according to latitude; spring (September&#x2013;October) in southern Australia, April to July in northern Australia and winter (June&#x2013;August) in southern Queensland. In spring the pair begins a five-month period of partnership to raise their young. The female lays two to four <span>eggs</span> within a month, and relies on the size of the nest to conserve heat. The eggs are whitish with bold splotches of reddish-brown and are about 6.2&#xA0;cm &#xD7;&#xA0;4.5&#xA0;cm (2.4&#xA0;in &#xD7;&#xA0;1.8&#xA0;in) and weigh about 65&#xA0;g (2.3&#xA0;oz). The eggs are incubated for about 5 weeks to hatching.</p>
<p>The newly hatched chicks weigh only 50&#x2013;60&#xA0;g (1.8&#x2013;2.1&#xA0;oz), but fledge in 8&#x2013;10 weeks. A study on <span>Kangaroo Island</span>, South Australia, had an average time between hatching and fledging of 69 days. The same study found an average of 0.66 young fledged per year per occupied territory, and 0.92 young fledged per year per active nest. Some 22% of surviving young either remained on the island, or returned at maturity to join the breeding population. When food is scarce, the first chicks to hatch are most likely to survive. The typical lifespan is 7&#x2013;10 years, though rarely individuals can grow to as old as 20&#x2013;25 years. The oldest European wild osprey on record lived to be over thirty years of age. In North America, <span>great horned owls</span>, <span>golden eagles</span>, and <span>bald eagles</span> are the only major predators of ospreys, capable of taking both nestlings and adults. However, <span>kleptoparasitism</span> by bald eagles, where the larger raptor steals the osprey's catch, is more common than predation. The <span>white-tailed eagle</span>, which is very similar to the bald eagle, may harass or predate the osprey in Eurasia. <span>Raccoons</span> can be a serious threat to nestlings or eggs if they can access the nest. <span>Nile crocodiles</span> have been observed to grab ospreys while they hunt. Endoparasitic <span>trematodes</span> (<i>Scaphanocephalus expansus</i> and <i>Neodiplostomum</i> spp.) have been recorded in wild ospreys.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>
<p><span>European</span> breeders winter in <span>Africa</span>. <span>American</span> and <span>Canadian</span> breeders winter in <span>South America</span>, although some stay in the southernmost <span>U.S.</span> states such as <span>Florida</span> and <span>California</span>. Some ospreys from Florida migrate to South America. <span>Australasian</span> ospreys tend not to <span>migrate</span>.</p>
<p>Studies of Swedish ospreys showed that females tend to migrate to Africa earlier than the males. More stopovers are made during their autumn migration. The variation of timing and duration in autumn was more variable than in spring. Although migrating predominantly in the day, they sometimes fly in the dark hours particularly in crossings over water and cover on average 260&#x2013;280&#xA0;km (160&#x2013;170&#xA0;mi) per day with a maximum of 431&#xA0;km (268&#xA0;mi) per day. European birds may also winter in South Asia, an osprey ringed in Norway has been recovered in western India.</p>

<p>The osprey has a large range, covering 9,670,000 square kilometres (3,730,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) in just Africa and the Americas, and has a large global population estimated at 460,000 individuals. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and for these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern. There is evidence for regional decline in South Australia where former territories at locations in the <span>Spencer Gulf</span> and along the lower <span>Murray River</span> have been vacant for decades.</p>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the main threats to osprey populations were egg collectors and hunting of the adults along with other birds of prey, but osprey populations declined drastically in many areas in the 1950s and 1960s; this appeared to be in part due to the toxic effects of insecticides such as <span>DDT</span> on reproduction. The pesticide interfered with the bird's <span>calcium</span> metabolism which resulted in thin-shelled, easily broken or infertile eggs. Possibly because of the banning of DDT in many countries in the early 1970s, together with reduced persecution, the osprey, as well as other affected <span>bird of prey</span> species, have made significant recoveries. In South Australia, nesting sites on the <span>Eyre Peninsula</span> and <span>Kangaroo Island</span> are vulnerable to unmanaged coastal recreation and encroaching urban development.</p>
<p>The osprey is the <span>provincial bird</span> of both <span>Nova Scotia</span>, Canada and <span>S&#xF6;dermanland</span>, Sweden.</p>

<p>The Roman writer <span>Pliny the Elder</span> reported that parent ospreys made their young fly up to the sun as a test, and dispatch any that failed.</p>
<p>Another odd legend regarding this fish-eating bird of prey, derived from the writings of <span>Albertus Magnus</span> and recorded in <span>Holinshed's</span> <i>Chronicles</i>, was that it had one webbed foot and one taloned foot.</p>
<p>There was a medieval belief that fish were so mesmerised by the osprey that they turned belly-up in surrender, and this is referenced by <span>Shakespeare</span> in Act 4 Scene 5 of <i><span>Coriolanus</span></i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think he'll be to Rome<br/>
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it<br/>
By sovereignty of nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Buddhism, the osprey is sometimes represented as the "King of Birds", especially in the <i>'The J&#x101;taka: Or, Stories of the Buddha&#x2019;s Former Births'</i> , no.486.</p>
<p>The Irish poet <span>William Butler Yeats</span> used a grey wandering osprey as a representation of sorrow in <i>The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems</i> (1889).</p>
<p>The osprey is depicted as a white eagle in <span>heraldry</span>, and more recently has become a symbol of positive responses to nature, and has been featured on more than 50 international <span>postage stamps</span>.</p>
<p><span id="Provincial_bird"/>In 1994, the osprey was declared the provincial bird of <span>Nova Scotia</span>, <span>Canada</span>.</p>
<p>The osprey is used as a brand name for various products and sports teams. Examples include: the <i><span>Ospreys</span></i> (a <span>Welsh</span>, <span>Rugby</span> team, of the European country of <span>Wales</span>); the <span>Geraldton</span> skiing team (in <span>Western Australia</span>); the <i><span>North Florida Ospreys</span></i> (a <span>NCAA</span> <span>Division II intercollegiate athletics team</span>), the <i><span>Missoula Osprey</span></i> (a <span>minor league baseball</span> team); the <i><span>Seattle Seahawks</span></i> (an <span>American football</span> team of the <span>National Conference</span>); the <i><span>Wagner Seahawks</span></i> (a NCAA <span>Division I intercollegiate athletics team</span>); and the <i><span>Cold Spring Harbor Seahawks</span></i> (a <span>High school football</span> team in <span>Cold Spring Harbor, New York</span>).</p>
<p>Examples of the osprey used as a mascot include: <i>Ozzie Osprey</i> (of the <span>University of North Florida</span>); <i>Talon the Osprey</i> of <span>Richard Stockton College</span>; <i>Sammy the Seahawk</i> (of <span>University of North Carolina Wilmington</span>); the <i><span>Wells International Seahawks</span></i> (of <span>Bangkok, Thailand</span>); the <i><span>Salve Regina Seahawks</span></i> (of <span>Newport, Rhode Island</span>); and the <i><span>LA Harbor College Seahawks</span></i> (of <span>South Bay</span>).</p>
