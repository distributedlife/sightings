<p>The <b>chestnut-eared bunting</b> (<i>Emberiza fucata</i>, also called <b>grey-headed bunting</b>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>bunting</span> family <span>Emberizidae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is 15 to 16&#xA0;cm in length. The plumage is mostly brown with dark streaks. The male has a grey crown and nape with dark streaks, chestnut ear-coverts and bands of black and chestnut across the breast. There is a <span>rufous</span> patch on the shoulders and the rump is also rufous. Females are similar to the males but duller with a less distinct head and breast pattern. First-winter birds are plainer but show warm brown ear-coverts and have an obvious ring around the eye.</p>
<p>Its voice is similar to the <span>rustic bunting</span> but quieter. The song is a rapid twittering which begins with staccato notes and then accelerates before ending with a distinctive two or three note phrase. The call is an explosive <i>pzick</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The breeding range extends from the <span>Himalayas</span> locally across <span>China</span> to south-eastern <span>Siberia</span>, <span>Korea</span> and northern <span>Japan</span>. Northern birds migrate south to winter in southern Japan, southern China, <span>Taiwan</span>, north-east <span>India</span> and <span>south-east Asia</span>. The species is a <span>vagrant</span> to <span>Kazakhstan</span> and in October 2004 the first European record occurred at <span>Fair Isle</span> in <span>Scotland</span>. Preferred habitats include scrub, fields and grassland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>The <span>cup-shaped nest</span> is built at ground level or low in a bush. Three to six eggs are laid with four being most common. These are whitish with reddish-brown speckling and are incubated for 12 days. The breeding season is variable, lasting from May to August in India, May to July in <span>Honsh&#x16B;</span> and June to August in <span>Hokkaid&#x14D;</span>.</p>
