<p>The <b>Steller's eider</b> (<i>Polysticta stelleri</i>) is a smallish <span>sea duck</span> that breeds along the Arctic coasts of eastern <span>Siberia</span> and <span>Alaska</span>. The lined nest is built on tundra close to the sea, and 6-10 eggs are laid.</p>
<p>It <span>winters</span> somewhat farther south in the <span>Bering Sea</span>, northern <span>Scandinavia</span> and the <span>Baltic Sea</span>. It can form large flocks, up to 200,000 <span>birds</span> on suitable coastal waters. It is scarce south of its wintering range.</p>
<p>This species dives for <span>crustaceans</span> and <span>molluscs</span>, with <span>mussels</span> being a favoured food.</p>
<p>This species is the smallest <span>eider</span> at 45&#xA0;cm long. The male is unmistakable with its black upperparts and neck collar, white head and yellowish underparts. The drake's call is a deep crooning, although it is relatively quiet compared to the <i>Somateria</i> eiders.</p>
<p>The female is a dark brown bird, smaller with a more typically <span>duck</span>-shaped head and body than other eider species. She also has a repertoire of grunts and whistles.</p>
<p>This bird is named after the German naturalist <span>Georg Steller</span>.</p>
<p>The Steller's eider is thought to have hybridised with the <span>common eider</span> on at least two occasions in the wild. A drake showing characters of both species was present at <span>Cuxhaven</span>, <span>Niedersachsen</span>, <span>Germany</span> on 17 November 1993. Another drake was seen in <span>Vadso harbour</span>, <span>Varanger</span>, <span>Norway</span> on 7 April 1995; a photograph of this bird was published accompanying Forsman (1995).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The Steller's eider is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. There is an active recovery plan in <span>Alaska</span>.</p>
