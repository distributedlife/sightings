<p>The <b>Allen's gallinule</b> (<i>Porphyrio alleni</i>), formerly known as the <b>lesser gallinule</b> is a small waterbird of the family <i>Rallidae</i>. Its former binomial name is <i>Porphyrula alleni</i>.</p>
<p>Its breeding habitat is marshes and lakes in sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>. They build a floating nest in marshes and swamps, laying 2-5 <span>eggs</span>. This species is partially <span>migratory</span>, undertaking seasonal movements.</p>
<p>Remarkably, this apparently weakly flying bird is not only the only species with a purely sub-Saharan African range to have reached <span>Great Britain</span>, but has done so twice. It has also occurred as a vagrant in several other <span>European</span> countries.</p>
<p>They are similar in size to the only slightly larger <span>water rail</span>. The Allen's gallinule has a short red bill, greenish back and purple upperparts. They have red legs with long toes, and a short tail which is white with a dark central bar underneath. Breeding males have a blue <span>frontal shield</span>, which is green in the female. Immature Allen's gallinules are sandy brown with a buff undertail. The downy chicks are black, as with all <span>rails</span>.</p>
<p>These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat <span>insects</span> and aquatic animals. They nod their heads as they swim.</p>
<p>Allen's gallinules are very secretive in the breeding season, particularly in the dense swamps they favour, and are mostly heard rather than seen. They are then rather noisy birds, with a sharp nasal <i>pruk</i> call. They can be easier to see on migration or when wintering.</p>
<p>This bird is named after British naval officer Rear-Admiral <span>William Allen</span> (1770-1843).</p>
