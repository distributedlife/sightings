<p>The <b>Terek sandpiper</b> (<i>Xenus cinereus</i>) is a small <span>migratory</span> <span>Palearctic</span> <span>wader</span> <span>species</span>, the <span>only member</span> of the <span>genus</span> <i><b>Xenus</b></i>. It is named after the <span>Terek River</span> which flows into the west of the <span>Caspian Sea</span>, as it was first observed around this area.</p>

<p>Slightly larger than the <span>Common Sandpiper</span> at 22&#x2013;25&#xA0;cm length, its long upcurved bill &#x2013; somewhat reminiscent of an <span>avocet</span>'s, but not as strongly curved &#x2013; makes it very distinctive. As the scientific specific name implies, this wader has a grey back, face and breast in all <span>plumages</span>; a white <span>supercilium</span> may appear more or less distinct. The belly is whitish and the feet yellow; the <span>bill</span> has a yellowish base, with the rest being black.</p>
<p>The call is a high whistle.</p>
<p>Among the <span>Scolopacidae</span>, <i>Xenus</i> is part of the <span>shank</span>-<span>tattler</span>-<span>phalarope</span> <span>clade</span> and less closely related to the <span>calidrid</span> sandpipers. Based on the degree of <span>DNA sequence</span> divergence and putative shank and phalarope <span>fossils</span> from around the <span>Oligocene</span>/<span>Miocene</span> boundary some 23-22 <span>million years ago</span>, the Terek Sandpiper presumably diverged from their relatives in the <span>Late Oligocene</span>. Given the numerous <span>basal</span> fossils of the group found in <span>Eurasia</span> it is likely that the Terek Sandpiper lineage originated there, possibly by being isolated as the remains of the <span>Turgai Sea</span> dried up, which happened just around this time.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_ecology">Distribution and ecology</span></h2>
<p>This bird breeds near water in the <span>taiga</span> from <span>Finland</span> through northern <span>Siberia</span> to the <span>Kolyma River</span>, and <span>migrate</span> south in winter to tropical coasts in east Africa, south Asia and <span>Australia</span>, usually preferring muddy areas. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, and particularly in autumn it is sometimes seen passing through the <span>Marianas</span> on migration; on <span>Palau</span>, further off its usual migration route, it is decidedly uncommon on the other hand. Almost annually and apparently more and more often in recent times, a few birds stray to <span>Alaska</span> and the <span>Aleutian</span> and <span>Pribilof Islands</span>. Every few years, individual vagrants are recorded in the <span>Neotropics</span>, where they arrive either as migrating birds from Africa, or as North American strays accompanying local waders south for winter. Such vagrants have been recorded as far south as <span>Argentina</span>.</p>
<p>It feeds in a distinctive and very active way, chasing insects and other mobile prey, and sometimes then running to the water's edge to wash its catch. It lays three or four eggs in a lined ground scrape.</p>

Terek Sandpiper <i><span>Xenus cinereus</span></i> &amp; Little Stint <i><span>Calidris minuta</span></i> in <span>Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary</span>, <span>Andhra Pradesh</span>, <span>India</span>.</div>

<p>The Terek Sandpiper likes to associate with <span>Ruddy Turnstones</span> (<i>Arenaria interpres</i>), smallish <span>calidrids</span>, and <i><span>Charadrius</span></i> (but maybe not <i><span>Pluvialis</span></i>) <span>plovers</span>; a vagrant bird at <span>Paraty</span> (<span>Rio de Janeiro state</span>) was noted to pair up with a <span>Spotted Sandpiper</span> (<i>Actitis macularius</i>). Thus it may be that the Terek Sandpiper under natural conditions may mate with <span>Common Sandpiper</span> (<i>A. hypoleucos</i>), the Old World <span>sister species</span> of <span>Spotted Sandpiper</span> (<i>A. macularius</i>). As <span>hybridisation in shorebirds</span> is extremely commonplace and <i>Actitis</i> is among the closer relatives of the Terek Sandpiper, such pairings (should they indeed occur) may produce <span>hybrid</span> offspring.</p>
<p>This is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. Widespread and often quite commonly seen, the Terek Sandpiper is not considered a threatened species by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
