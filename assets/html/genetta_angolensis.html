<p>The <b>Angolan genet</b> (<i>Genetta angolensis</i>), is a <span>mammal</span> from the <span>Carnivora</span> order, related to <span>civets</span> and <span>linsangs</span>. It is one of fourteen species of <span>genets</span>. It is <span>endemic</span> to <span>Angola</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Zambia</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Angolan genet has fur that is reddish grey to dark grey in color, with small brown spots on its body and stripes on its ringed tail that is bushier than that of other genets. It has a black muzzle, with white around the eyes and mouth. This species has a dark dorsal stripe who runs from the base of the skull down to the tail, which can be raised defensively like a mane when the animal is threatened. Five rows of elongated spots or stripes run down either side of its neck. Melanistic individuals also exist.</p>
<p>Its claws are semi-retractable. Its body is long and lean, set on short legs. It can erect a mane of hair along its back when frightened. The Angolan genet's mane is relatively long, being about 2 inches (6&#xA0;cm) in length. Like all viverrids, it has well-developed <span>musk glands</span> used to mark territory. Genets have 40 teeth. Females have 4 teats, and males have a well-developed baculum. Both the front and hind feet have five digits, with well-furred soles. Its eyes are large and round, and its ears are large and triangular shaped.</p>
