<p>The <b>African wood owl</b> (<i>Strix woodfordii</i>) is a medium-sized owl with dark eyes and no ear tufts. It is 30 to 36&#xA0;cm long and weighs from 240 to 350&#xA0;grams. It lives in Africa from <span>Senegambia</span> to <span>Sudan</span> and south to <span>Angola</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, and on the east coast to <span>South Africa</span>. It lives mainly in forest and woodland though it sometimes inhabits plantations. It eats mostly insects but will also eat reptiles, small mammals, and other birds. It breeds from July to October and lays 1 to 3 eggs in a hollow in a tree. It will then incubate the eggs for about 31 days. Five weeks after the eggs hatch, the young will leave the nest and can fly 2 weeks later. The young will remain with the parents for about four months and will sometimes stay until the next breeding season. Its call is a loud series of fast hoots. It is not threatened and is common in almost all of its range.</p>
