<p>The <b>narcissus flycatcher</b> (<i>Ficedula narcissina</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> bird in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family. It is native to east Asia, from <span>Sakhalin</span> to the north, through <span>Japan</span> across through <span>Korea</span>, <span>mainland China</span>, and <span>Taiwan</span>, wintering in southeast Asia, including the <span>Philippines</span> and <span>Borneo</span>. It is highly <span>migratory</span>, and has been found as a vagrant from Australia in the south to Alaska in the north .</p>
<p>Narcissus flycatcher males are very distinctive in full breeding plumage, having a black crown and mantle, a bright orange throat with paler chest and underparts, an orange-yellow eyebrow, black wings with a white wing patch, an orange-yellow rump, and a black tail. Non-breeding males have varying levels of yellow. Females are completely dissimilar, with generally buff-brown coloration, with rusty-colored wings, and a two-toned eyering.</p>
<p>This species primarily feeds on insects, and lives in deciduous woodlands. Breeding males sing in repeated melodious whistles.</p>
<p>There are several subspecies, largely determined by plumage and range variations, at least of which has been split off as separate species.</p>

<p>"<i>F. beijingnica</i>", proposed as a separate species called <b>Beijing flycatcher</b> or <b>Peking flycatcher</b>, is now considered by experts to be the first-summer male of <i>F. (n.) elisae</i> and thus no longer a valid taxon .</p>
<p>The name of the bird is a reference to the yellow color of many varieties of the <span>narcissus</span> flower.</p>
