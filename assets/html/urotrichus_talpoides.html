<p>The <b>Japanese shrew mole</b> or <i><b>Himizu</b></i> (<b>&#x30D2;&#x30DF;&#x30BA;</b>) (<i><b>Urotrichus talpoides</b></i>) is a species of <span>mammal</span> in the <span>Talpidae</span> family. It is <span>endemic</span> to Japan and is found on <span>Honshu</span>, <span>Shikoku</span>, <span>Kyushu</span>, <span>Awaji Island</span>, <span>Shodo Island</span>, <span>Oki Islands</span>, <span>Tsushima Island</span>, <span>Goto Islands</span>, <span>Mishima Island</span> (Yamaguchi Prefecture), and <span>Awashima Island</span> (Niigata Prefecture), but is absent from <span>Hokkaido</span>. It is one of three <span>Urotrichini</span> and it is the only species in the genus <i>Urotrichus</i>. It is common between sea level and approximately 2,000 m.</p>
<p><span>Heinrich B&#xFC;rger</span>, assistant of <span>Philipp Franz von Siebold</span>, collected specimens of <i>Urotrichus talpoides</i> near <span>Dejima</span> between 1824 and 1826, found lying dead in the fields, which were ultimately described by Temminck after shipping them to the Netherlands.</p>
