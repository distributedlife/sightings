<p>The <b>Red-eyed Dove</b> (<i>Streptopelia semitorquata</i>) is a <span>pigeon</span> which is a widespread resident breeding bird in <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. It is a common, if not abundant, species in most habitats other than desert.</p>
<p>This species builds a stick nest in a tree and lays two white <span>eggs</span>. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.</p>
<p>Red-eyed Dove is a largish, stocky pigeon, typically 34&#xA0;cm in length. Its back, wings and tail are pale brown. When flying, it shows blackish flight <span>feathers</span>. The head and underparts are dark vinous-pink, shading to pale grey on the face. There is a black hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red. The call is a loud <i>doo-doo-du-du</i>.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults, and have scalloping on the body feathers.</p>
<p>Red-eyed Doves eat grass seeds, grains and other vegetation. They often forage on the ground.</p>
<p>Like several other species in this genus, they are not particularly gregarious and often feed alone or in pairs.</p>
