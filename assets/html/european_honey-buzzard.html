</div>
<p>The <b>European honey buzzard</b> (<i>Pernis apivorus</i>), also known as the <b>pern</b> or <b>common pern</b>, is a <span>bird of prey</span> in the family <span>Accipitridae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>Despite its English name, this species is more closely related to kites of the genera <i><span>Leptodon</span></i> and <i><span>Chondrohierax</span></i> than to true <span>buzzards</span> in <i><span>Buteo</span></i>. The <span>binomen</span> is due to <span>Linn&#xE9;</span>, derived from <span>&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, an Aristotelian term for a bird of prey, and Latin <i>apivorus</i> "bee-eating" (although <span>bees</span> are much less important than wasps in the bird's diet).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The European honey buzzard is a summer <span>migrant</span> to most of <span>Europe</span> and western <span>Asia</span>, wintering in tropical <span>Africa</span>. It is seen in a wide range of habitats, but generally prefers woodland and exotic plantations.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Movements">Movements</span></h3>
<p>Being a long distance migrant, the honey buzzard relies on magnetic orientation to find its way south, as well as a visual memory of remarkable geographical features such as mountain ranges and rivers, along the way. It avoids large expanses of water over which it cannot soar. Accordingly, great numbers of honey buzzards can be seen crossing the <span>Mediterranean sea</span> over its narrowest stretches, such as the <span>Gibraltar Strait</span>, the <span>Bosphorus</span>, or in <span>Israel</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_in_Britain">Status in Britain</span></h3>
<p>The bird is an uncommon breeder in, and a scarce though increasing migrant to, Britain. Its most well-known summer population is in the <span>New Forest</span> (Hampshire) but it is also found in the <span>Tyne Valley</span> (Northumberland), <span>Wareham Forest</span> (Dorset), <span>Swanton Novers</span> Great Wood (Norfolk), the <span>Neath Valleys</span> (South Wales), the <span>Clumber Park</span> area (Nottinghamshire), near Wykeham Forest (North Yorkshire), Haldon Forest Park (Devon) and elsewhere.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The 52&#x2013;60-centimetre-long (20&#x2013;24&#xA0;in) honey buzzard is larger and longer winged, with a 135&#x2013;150-centimetre (53&#x2013;59&#xA0;in) wingspan, when compared to the smaller <span>common buzzard</span> <i>Buteo buteo</i>. It appears longer necked with a small head, and soars on flat wings. It has a longer tail, which has fewer bars than the <i>Buteo</i> buzzard, usually with two narrow dark bars and a broad dark sub-terminal bar. The sexes can be <span>distinguished on plumage</span>, which is unusual for a large bird of prey. The male has a blue-grey head, while the female's head is brown. The female is slightly larger and darker than the male.</p>
<p>The soaring <span>jizz</span> is quite diagnostic; the wings are held straight with the wing tips horizontal or sometimes slightly pointed down. The head protrudes forwards with a slight kink downwards and sometimes a very angular chest can be seen, similar to a <span>sparrowhawk</span>, although this may not be diagnostic. The angular chest is most pronounced when seen in direct flight with tail narrowed. The call is a clear <i>peee-lu</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mimicry">Mimicry</span></h3>
<p>It has been suggested that the similarity in plumage between juvenile European honey buzzard and common buzzard has arisen as a partial protection against predation by <span>northern goshawks</span>. Although that formidable predator is capable of killing both species, it is likely to be more cautious about attacking the better protected <i>Buteo</i> species, with its stronger bill and talons. Similar <span>Batesian mimicry</span> is shown by the <span>Asian</span> <i>Pernis</i> species, which resemble the <i>Spizaetus</i> <span>hawk-eagles</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It is sometimes seen soaring in thermals. When flying in wooded vegetation, honey buzzards usually fly quite low and perch in mid canopy, holding the body relatively horizontal with tail drooping. The birds also hop from branch to branch, each time flapping their wings once, and so emitting a loud clap. The bird often appears restless with much ruffling of the wings and shifting around on its perch. The honey buzzard often inspects possible locations of food from its perch, cocking its head this way and that to get a good look at possible food locations. This behaviour is reminiscent of an inquisitive <span>parrot</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The honey buzzard breeds in <span>woodland</span>, and is inconspicuous except in the spring, when the mating display includes wing-clapping. Breeding males are fiercely territorial.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>It is a specialist feeder, living mainly on the larvae and nests of <span>wasps</span> and hornets, although it will take small mammals, reptiles and birds. It is the only known predator of the <span>Asian giant hornet</span>. It is thought that honey buzzards have a chemical deterrent in their feathers that protects them from wasp attack.</p>
