<p>The <b>southern white-faced owl</b> (<i>Ptilopsis granti</i>) is a fairly small <span>owl</span> in the family <span>Strigidae</span>. It is native to the southern half of <span>Africa</span>. It was formerly regarded as a <span>subspecies</span> of the <span>northern white-faced owl</span> (<i>P. leucopsis</i>) but the two are now commonly treated as separate species.</p>
<p>It is 22-28 centimetres long and weighs 185-220 grams. The upperparts are grey with dark streaks and there are white spots on the scapular feathers. The underparts are whitish with dark streaks. The face is white with a black border and black around the large orange eyes. The head has two short "ear" tufts with black tips. <span>Juvenile</span> birds have a greyish face. The Northern White-faced Owl is usually paler and browner with reduced streaking below.</p>
<p>The call is a series of fast, bubbling hoots. It is uttered at night and frequently repeated. The northern white-faced owl has a very different two-note call.</p>
<p>Its range extends from <span>Gabon</span> eastwards to southern <span>Kenya</span> and southwards to <span>Namibia</span> and northern <span>South Africa</span>. It inhabits <span>savanna</span> and dry <span>woodland</span>. It is usually seen alone or in pairs. It hunts for large <span>invertebrates</span> and some small <span>mammals</span>, <span>birds</span> and <span>reptiles</span> are also taken.</p>
<p>The <span>eggs</span> are usually laid in the old <span>nest</span> of another bird. The clutch contains two or three eggs which are <span>incubated</span> for about 30 days. The young birds leave the nest about a month after hatching.</p>
