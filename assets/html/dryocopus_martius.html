<p>The <b>black woodpecker</b> (<i>Dryocopus martius</i>) is a large <span>woodpecker</span> that lives in mature forest across the northern <span>palearctic</span>. It is the sole representative of its <span>genus</span> in that region. Its range is expanding in <span>Eurasia</span>. It does not <span>migrate</span>. This species is closely related to and fills the same <span>ecological niche</span> in Europe as the <span>pileated woodpecker</span> of <span>North America</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range">Range</span></h2>
<p>The range of the black woodpecker spreads east from <span>France</span> across the whole of <span>Europe</span>, excluding the <span>United Kingdom</span> and northern <span>Scandinavia</span>. It is also native to parts of <span>Asia</span>, including <span>Korea</span>, <span>Japan</span> and <span>China</span>, and to the <span>Middle East</span>, including <span>Iran</span> and <span>Kazakhstan</span>. The southern limits of these woodpeckers range are in <span>Spain</span> and <span>Italy</span>, and it has also been recorded as a vagrant in <span>Portugal</span>. The species is generally more uncommon and more discontinuous in distribution in the Asian part of its range.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The black woodpecker measures 45 to 55&#xA0;cm (18 to 22&#xA0;in) long with a 64 to 84&#xA0;cm (25 to 33&#xA0;in) wingspan. Body weight is approximately 250 to 400&#xA0;g (8.8 to 14.1&#xA0;oz) on average. Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 22.7 to 26&#xA0;cm (8.9 to 10.2&#xA0;in), the <span>tail</span> is 15.9 to 17.3&#xA0;cm (6.3 to 6.8&#xA0;in), the very long <span>bill</span> is 5 to 6.7&#xA0;cm (2.0 to 2.6&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 3.6 to 4&#xA0;cm (1.4 to 1.6&#xA0;in). It is easily the largest woodpecker in its range and is second in size only to the <span>great slaty woodpecker</span> amongst the woodpecker species certain to exist. The <span>plumage</span> of this <span>crow-sized</span> woodpecker is entirely black apart from a red crown. In males, the entire crown is red, but in females only the top hindcrown is red with the rest of the body all black. The juvenile black woodpecker is similar but is less glossy, with a duller red crown and a paler grey throat and bill . The piercing yellow eyes and manic, high-pitched calls of the black woodpecker have made it the villain of fairy tales throughout its range. Their voice is remarkable in that it has two different calls. One is a short single high-pitched note, a loud, whistling <i>kree-kree-kree</i>, done only twice in a row. The other is a screech-like shrill while in flight. Unlike other woodpecker species, the black woodpecker does not have a dipping, bounding flight but instead flies with slow, unsteady-seeming wing beats with its head raised.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The black woodpecker is mainly found in forested regions, with a preference for extensive, mature woodland, including <span>coniferous</span>, <span>tropical</span>, <span>subtropical</span> and <span>boreal forests</span>. It is very widespread throughout mountainous and lowland forests. It is more likely to occur in marginal woods near human habitations during the non-breeding season. This species has been observed at elevations between 100 and 2,400&#xA0;m (330 and 7,870&#xA0;ft).</p>

Tree work by black woodpecker</div>

<p>The woodpecker feeds by using its bill to hammer on dead trees to dig out <span>carpenter ants</span> and wood-boring grubs. Like all woodpeckers, this species has a specially adapted neck containing very strong muscles, which allow it to endlessly hack away at tree bark. Due to the size of its bill and large size and great physical power of this bird, it can access prey fairly deep within a tree. In order to position itself correctly, it has short, stumpy legs, as well as long, sharp claws and very stiff tail feathers. The woodpecker will more than likely choose a tree with a fungal disease, such as heart rot, although some will utilise a living, healthy tree. Once a hole has been made, the black woodpecker chips downwards through the trunk of the tree, creating a nesting chamber, the only lining being the woodchips created throughout the process. The black woodpecker&#x2019;s excavations provide homes for many other species of bird and mammal, and is therefore considered to be a "keystone" species in many of its habitats throughout its range. It not only provides habitats for other species, but also controls populations of wood-boring insects, helping to protect the trees.</p>
<p>When the nest is ready, the female lays a single clutch of two to eight eggs, the average being four to six. The nest hole, usually in a live poplar or pine tree. The breeding pair take it in turns to incubate the eggs, also sharing duties of feeding and brooding the chicks once they have hatched. The nestlings may fight their way to the entrance of the nest in order to be fed first. After 18 to 35 days the young black woodpecker will leave the nest, staying with the adults for another week.</p>
