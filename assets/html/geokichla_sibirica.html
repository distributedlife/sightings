<p>The <b>Siberian thrush</b> (<i>Geokichla sibirica</i>) is a member of the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae.</p>
<p>It breeds in <span>taiga</span> in <span>Siberia</span>. It is strongly migratory, with most birds moving to southeastern <span>Asia</span> during the winter. It is a very rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>. It is very secretive.</p>
<p>The Siberian thrush is similar in size to the <span>song thrush</span>. It is <span>omnivorous</span>, eating a wide range of <span>insects</span>, <span>earthworms</span> and berries.</p>
<p>The male Siberian thrush is a dark blue-grey above and below, with a white stripe above the eye. The lower belly and flanks are white. The female is a much browner bird, with a buff stripe above the eye.</p>
<p>A striking identification feature of both sexes in flight is the black band on the white underwings, a feature shared with the <span>scaly thrush</span>.</p>
