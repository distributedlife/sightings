<p>The <b>Rubeho Akalat</b> (<i>Sheppardia aurantiithorax</i>) is a member of the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family (Muscicapiidae), known from the <span>Eastern Arc</span> of <span>Tanzania</span>. <span>Akalats</span> trapped in 1989 here were assumed to be an isolated population of <span>Iringa Akalat</span> which occurs c. 150&#xA0;km to the south, but further specimens collected in 2000 led to the description of the bird as a <span>new species</span>. The bird's English name relates to its <span>type locality</span>, <span>Rubeho</span>, <span>Morogoro</span>; the scientific name to the <span>ochraceous colour</span> on its throat and upper breast.</p>
<p>The species is thought to be fairly common in <span>montane forests</span> within its small range, but its very limited distribution has let to it being classified as <span>Endangered</span> species in the 2008 <span>IUCN Red List</span>.</p>
