<p>The <b>common duiker</b>, <i>Sylvicapra grimmia</i>, also known as the <b>grey</b> or <b>bush duiker</b>, is a small <span>antelope</span> with small horns found in west, central, east, and southern <span>Africa</span>- essentially everywhere in Africa south of the <span>Sahara</span>, excluding the Horn of Africa and the rainforests of the central and western parts of the continent. Generally, they are found in habitats with sufficient vegetation cover to allow them to hide&#x2014;<span>savanna</span> and hilly areas, including the fringes of human settlements.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Colouration of this species varies widely over its vast geographic range. As many as 19 <span>subspecies</span> are thought to exist, ranging from chestnut in forested areas of <span>Angola</span> to grizzled gray in northern savannas and light brown shades in arid regions. It grows to about 50&#xA0;cm (20&#xA0;in) in height and generally weighs 12 to 25&#xA0;kg (26 to 55&#xA0;lb); although females are generally larger and heavier than the males. The males' horns can grow to 11&#xA0;cm (4.3&#xA0;in) long.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Breeding is year round and the female gives birth to one fawn after a <span>gestation period</span> of what is variously estimated at 3.0 to 7.5 months. The common duiker has a wide diet; beyond <span>herbivorous</span> <span>browsing</span> for leaves, flowers, fruits and tubers, they will also eat insects, frogs, small birds and mammals, and even <span>carrion</span>. As long as they have vegetation to eat (from which they get some water), they can go without drinking for very long periods. In the rainy season, they will frequently not drink water at all, instead obtaining fluids from fruits. They will often scavenge for these fruits below trees in which <span>monkeys</span> are feeding. They are active both day and night, but become more <span>nocturnal</span> near human settlements.</p>

<p>Males are <span>territorial</span> and smear gland secretions on rocks and branches to mark their territories; their preferred resting places are generally on elevated ground, where they can observe their territory. Females, by contrast, prefer deeper cover. The overall success of this species stems from its ability to inhabit a wide variety of habitats, as well as from its adaptable, <span>generalist</span> diet.</p>
