<p>The <b>Plain-backed Pipit</b> or <b>Plain Pipit</b> (<i>Anthus leucophrys</i>) is a medium-sized <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> which is a resident breeder in <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span>.</p>
<p>It is found in open habitats, especially short grassland and cultivation. It builds its cup-shaped nest on the ground and usually lays three eggs. Like other pipits, this species is insectivorous.</p>
<p>The Plain-backed Pipit is a large <span>pipit</span> at 17&#xA0;cm, but is otherwise an undistinguished looking species, faintly streaked grey-brown above and pale below with light breast streaking. It has a strong white <span>supercilium</span>, and dark moustachial stripes. It has long legs and tail, and a long dark bill. Sexes are similar, but juveniles have warmer brown upperparts.</p>
<p>Some care must be taken to distinguish this species from wintering <span>Tawny Pipits</span>, <i>Anthus campestris</i>. The Plain-backed Pipit is sturdier and darker than the Tawny, and stands more upright. Perhaps the best distinction is the characteristic "ssissik" call, quite different from the Tawny Pipit's "tchilip".</p>
