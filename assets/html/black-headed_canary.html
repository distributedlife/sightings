<p>The <b>black-headed canary</b> (<i>Serinus alario</i>) is a species of <span>finch</span> found in <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Namibia</span> and South Africa. It is sometimes placed in genus <i>Alario</i> as <i>Alario alario</i></p>
<p>Its <span>habitat</span> is dry open scrub and grassland, edges of cultivation and suburban gardens.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The black-headed canary is 12&#x2013;15&#xA0;cm in length. The adult male has rich brown upperparts and tail, a white hind collar, and mainly white underparts. The head and central breast are solidly black.</p>
<p>The adult female is similar, but has a dull grey head, and is dark-streaked on the head and upperparts. It has a rich brown wing bar. The juvenile resembles the female, but is paler, has streaking on the breast, and a weaker wing bar.</p>
<p>The <span>Damara canary</span>, <i>Serinus leucolaema</i>, is often considered to be a subspecies of black-headed canary. The male of that form has a strikingly different head pattern, with a white <span>supercilium</span>, and a white throat and fore neck with a black moustachial stripe. The black of the central breast is therefore separate from the black of the head.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Phylogeny">Phylogeny</span></h2>
<p>This species is phylogeneticagy included within the group of <span>Serinus syriacus</span> now thriving around the Mt Lebanon and other Asian and African patches in winter, together with <span>Serinus canicollis</span> (African distribution) and <span>Serinus pusillus</span> (Asian distribution) <span>Arnaiz-Villena et al, 1999</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Damara canary is a common and gregarious seedeater, forming flocks of up to 200 birds. Its call is a low <i>tseett</i>, and the male's song is jumble of unmusical notes.</p>
