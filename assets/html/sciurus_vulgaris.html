<p>The <b>red squirrel</b> or <b>Eurasian red squirrel</b> (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>tree squirrel</span> in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Sciurus</span></i> common throughout <span>Eurasia</span>. The red squirrel is an <span>arboreal</span>, <span>omnivorous</span> <span>rodent</span>.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, Italy and Ireland, numbers have decreased drastically in recent years, a decline associated with the introduction of the <span>eastern grey squirrel</span> (<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>) from <span>North America</span>, although habitat loss is also a factor.</p>

Profile of the Eurasian red squirrel in grey winter coat</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The red squirrel has a typical head-and-body length of 19 to 23&#xA0;cm (7.5 to 9 in), a tail length of 15 to 20&#xA0;cm (5.9 to 7.9 in) and a mass of 250 to 340g (8.8 to 12 oz). It is not <span>sexually dimorphic</span>, as males and females are the same size. The red squirrel is somewhat smaller than the eastern grey squirrel which has a head-and-body length of 25 to 30&#xA0;cm (9.5 to 12 in) and weighs between 400 and 800&#xA0;g (14 oz to 1.8&#xA0;lb). It is thought that the long tail helps the squirrel to balance and steer when jumping from tree to tree and running along branches and may keep the animal warm during sleep.</p>
<p>The coat of the red squirrel varies in colour with time of year and location. There are several different coat colour morphs ranging from black to red. Red coats are most common in <span>Great Britain</span>; in other parts of Europe and Asia <span>different coat colours</span> co-exist within populations, much like hair colour in some human populations. The underside of the squirrel is always white-cream in colour. The red squirrel sheds its coat twice a year, switching from a thinner summer coat to a thicker, darker winter coat with noticeably larger ear-tufts (a prominent distinguishing feature of this species) between August and November. A lighter, redder overall coat colour, along with the ear-tufts (in adults) and smaller size, distinguish the Eurasian red squirrel from the American eastern grey squirrel.</p>
<p>The red squirrel, like most tree squirrels, has sharp, curved <span>claws</span> to enable it to climb and descend broad tree trunks, thin branches and even house walls. Its strong hind legs enable it to leap gaps between trees.The red squirrel also has the ability to swim.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>Red squirrels occupy boreal, coniferous woods in northern Europe and Siberia, preferring Scots pine, Norway spruce and Siberian pine. In western and southern Europe they are found in broad-leaved woods where the mixture of tree and shrub species provides a better year round source of food. In most of the British Isles and in Italy, broad-leaved woodlands are now less suitable due to the better competitive feeding strategy of introduced grey squirrels.</p>

<p>Mating can occur in late winter during February and March and in summer between June and July. Up to two litters a year per female are possible. Each litter usually contains three or four young although as many as six may be born. <span>Gestation</span> is about 38 to 39 days. The young are looked after by the mother alone and are born helpless, blind and deaf and weigh between 10 and 15&#xA0;g. Their body is covered by hair at 21 days, their eyes and ears open after three to four weeks, and they develop all their teeth by 42 days. Juvenile red squirrels can eat solids around 40 days following birth and from that point can leave the nest on their own to find food; however, they still suckle from their mother until <span>weaning</span> occurs at 8 to 10 weeks.</p>
<p>During mating, males detect females that are in <span>&#x153;strus</span> by an odor that they produce, and although there is no courtship, the male will chase the female for up to an hour prior to mating. Usually multiple males will chase a single female until the dominant male, usually the largest in the group, mates with the female. Males and females will mate multiple times with many partners. Females must reach a minimum body mass before they enter &#x153;strus, and heavy females on average produce more young. If food is scarce breeding may be delayed. Typically a female will produce her first litter in her second year.</p>

<p>Red squirrels that survive their first winter have a life expectancy of 3 years. Individuals may reach 7 years of age, and 10 in captivity. Survival is positively related to availability of autumn&#x2013;winter tree seeds; on average, 75&#x2013;85% of juveniles die during their first winter, and mortality is approximately 50% for winters following the first.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The red squirrel is found in both <span>coniferous forest</span> and <span>temperate broadleaf</span> woodlands. The squirrel makes a <span>drey</span> (nest) out of twigs in a branch-fork, forming a domed structure about 25 to 30&#xA0;cm in diameter. This is lined with <span>moss</span>, leaves, grass and <span>bark</span>. Tree hollows and <span>woodpecker</span> holes are also used. The red squirrel is a solitary animal and is shy and reluctant to share food with others. However, outside the <span>breeding season</span> and particularly in winter, several red squirrels may share a drey to keep warm. Social organization is based on dominance hierarchies within and between sexes; although males are not necessarily dominant to females, the dominant animals tend to be larger and older than subordinate animals, and dominant males tend to have larger home ranges than subordinate males or females.</p>
<p>The red squirrel eats mostly the <span>seeds</span> of trees, neatly stripping conifer cones to get at the seeds within. <span>Fungi</span>, nuts (especially <span>hazelnuts</span> but also beech and chestnuts), <span>berries</span>, young shoots, and bird eggs are occasionally eaten. Occasionally the bark of trees is removed to allow access to <span>sap</span>. Between 60% and 80% of its active period may be spent foraging and feeding. Excess food is put into caches, either buried or in nooks or holes in trees, and eaten when food is scarce. Although the red squirrel remembers where it created caches at a better-than-chance level, its <span>spatial memory</span> is substantially less accurate and durable than that of grey squirrel; it therefore will often have to search for them when in need, and many caches are never found again. No territories are maintained, and the feeding areas of individuals overlap considerably.</p>
<p>The active period for the red squirrel is in <span>the morning and in the late afternoon and evening</span>. It often rests in its nest in the middle of the day, avoiding the heat and the high visibility to <span>birds of prey</span> that are dangers during these hours. During the winter, this mid-day rest is often much more brief, or absent entirely, although harsh weather may cause the animal to stay in its nest for days at a time.</p>
<p>Arboreal predators include small mammals such as the <span>pine marten</span>, wild <span>cats</span>, and the <span>stoat</span>, which preys on nestlings; birds, including <span>owls</span> and raptors such as the <span>goshawk</span> and <span>buzzards</span>, may also take the red squirrel. The <span>red fox</span>, cats and dogs can prey upon the red squirrel when it is on the ground. Humans influence the population size and mortality of the red squirrel by destroying or altering habitats, by causing road casualties, and by controlling populations of grey squirrels.</p>

</div>
<p>The red squirrel is protected in most of Europe, as it is listed in Appendix III of the <span>Bern Convention</span>; it is listed as Least Concern on the <span>IUCN Red List</span>. In some areas it is abundant and is hunted for its fur. Although not thought to be under any threat worldwide, the red squirrel has drastically reduced in number in the <span>United Kingdom</span>. Fewer than 140,000 individuals are thought to be left, approximately 85% of which are in <span>Scotland</span>, with the <span>Isle of Wight</span> being the largest haven in England. A local charity, the Wight Squirrel Project, supports red squirrel conservation on the Island. The population decrease in Britain is often ascribed to the introduction of the eastern grey squirrel from <span>North America</span>, but the loss and fragmentation of its native woodland habitat has also played a role.</p>
<p>Eradication of the grey squirrel from the North Wales Island of <span>Anglesey</span> began in January 1998. This facilitated the natural recovery of the small remnant red squirrel population and was followed by the successful reintroduction of the red squirrel into the pine stands of <span>Newborough Forest</span>. Subsequent reintroductions into broadleaved woodland followed and today the island has the single largest red squirrel population in Wales. <span>Brownsea Island</span> in <span>Poole Harbour</span> is also populated exclusively by red rather than grey squirrels (approximately 200 individuals).</p>

<p>Mainland initiatives in Southern Scotland and the North of England also rely upon grey squirrel control as the cornerstone of red squirrel conservation strategy. A local programme known as the "North East Scotland Biodiversity Partnership", an element of the national <span>Biodiversity Action Plan</span> has subsequently been established. This programme is administered by the <span>Grampian</span> Squirrel Society, with an aim of protecting the red squirrel; the programme centres on the <span>Banchory</span> and <span>Cults</span> areas. In 2008, the <span>Scottish Wildlife Trust</span> announced a four year project which commenced in the spring of 2009 called "Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels".</p>
<p>Other notable projects include red squirrel projects in the Greenfield Forest, including the buffer zones of <span>Mallerstang</span>, <span>Garsdale</span> and Widdale; the Northumberland <span>Kielder Forest</span> Project; and within the National Trust reserve in <span>Formby</span>. These projects were originally part of the Save Our Squirrels campaign that aimed to protect red squirrels in the north of England, but now form part of a five year Government-led partnership conservation project called &#x2018;Red Squirrels Northern England&#x2019;  to undertake grey squirrel control in areas important for red squirrels.</p>
<p>Outside the UK and Ireland, the impact of competition from the eastern grey squirrel has been observed in <span>Piedmont</span>, <span>Italy</span>, where two pairs escaped from captivity in 1948. A significant drop in red squirrel populations in the area has been observed since 1970, and it is feared that the eastern grey squirrel may expand into the rest of Europe.</p>

</div>
<p>The eastern grey squirrel and the red squirrel are not directly antagonistic, and violent conflict between these species is not a factor in the decline in red squirrel populations.</p>
<p>Research undertaken in 2007 in the UK credits the <span>Pine Marten</span> with reducing the population of the invasive eastern grey squirrel. Where the range of the expanding Pine Marten population meets that of the eastern grey squirrel, the population of these squirrels retreats. It is theorised that because the grey squirrel spends more time on the ground than the red, that they are far more likely to come in contact with this predator.</p>
<p>During October 2012, four male and one female red squirrel, on permanent loan from the <span>British Wildlife Centre</span>, were transported to <span>Tresco</span> in the <span>Isle of Scilly</span> by helicopter, and released into Abbey Wood, near the <span>Abbey Gardens</span>. Only two survived and a further twenty were transported and released in October, 2013. Although the red squirrel is not indigenous to the Isles of Scilly, those who supported this work intend to use Tresco as a &#x2033;safe haven&#x2033; for the endangered mammal as the islands are free of predators such <span>foxes</span>, and of the <span>squirrel pox</span> carrying grey squirrel.</p>

Various red squirrel subspecies; A) <i>S. v. vulgaris</i> from Sweden, B) <i>S. v. fuscoater</i> from Germany, C) <i>S. v. infuscatus</i> from central Spain</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There have been over 40 described <span>subspecies</span> of the red squirrel, but the taxonomic status of some of these is uncertain. A study published in 1971 recognises 16 subspecies and has served as a basis for subsequent taxonomic work. At present, there are 23 recognized subspecies.</p>

<p><i>S. vulgaris</i> is classed as a "prohibited new organism" under New Zealand's <span>Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996</span> preventing it from being imported into the country.<br style="clear:both;"/></p>
