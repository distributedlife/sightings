<p>The <b>Village Weaver</b> (<i>Ploceus cucullatus</i>), also known as the <b>Spotted-backed Weaver</b> or <b>Black-headed Weaver</b> (the latter leading to easy confusion with <i><span>P. melanocephalus</span></i>), is a species of <span>bird</span> found in much of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. It has also been <span>introduced</span> to <span>Hispaniola</span>, <span>Mauritius</span> and <span>R&#xE9;union</span>.</p>
<p>This often abundant species occurs in a wide range of open or semi-open <span>habitats</span>, including <span>woodlands</span> and human habitation, and frequently forms large noisy colonies in towns, villages and hotel grounds.</p>

Village Weaver colony in <span>The Gambia</span>. The nests are the round suspended objects.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This <span>weaver</span> builds a large coarsely woven <span>nest</span> made of grass and leaf strips with a downward facing entrance which is suspended from a branch in a tree. 2-3 <span>eggs</span> are laid. This is a colonial breeder, so many nests may hang from one tree.</p>
<p>The Village Weaver is a stocky 15&#x2013;17&#xA0;cm bird with a strong conical bill and dark reddish eyes. In the northern part of its range, the breeding male has a black head edged by chestnut (typically most distinct on the nape and chest). Towards the southern part of its <span>range</span>, the amount of black and chestnut diminish, and the breeding males of the southernmost <span>subspecies</span> only have a black face and throat, while the nape and crown are yellow. In all <span>subspecies</span> the breeding male has a black <span>bill</span>, black and yellow upperparts and wings, and yellow underparts.</p>
<p>The non-breeding male has a yellow head with an olive crown, grey upperparts and whitish underparts. The wings remain yellow and black.</p>
<p>The adult female has streaked olive upperparts, yellow and black wings, and pale yellow underparts. Young birds are like the female but browner on the back.</p>
<p>Village Weaver feeds principally on seeds and grain, and can be a crop pest, but it will readily take insects, especially when feeding young, which partially redresses the damage to agriculture.</p>
<p>The calls of this bird include harsh buzzes and chattering.</p>
