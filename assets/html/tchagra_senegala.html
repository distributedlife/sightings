<p>The <b>Black-crowned Tchagra</b> (<i>Tchagra senegala</i>) is a <span>bushshrike</span>. This family of <span>passerine</span> birds is closely related to the true <span>shrikes</span> in the family Laniidae, and was once included in that group.</p>
<p>This species is found in the <span>Arabian peninsula</span> and most of <span>Africa</span> in scrub, open woodland, semi-desert and cultivation.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>Black-crowned Tchagra is a colourful and unmistakable species, 19&#x2013;22&#xA0;cm in length. It has a black crown and eye stripes separated by a broad white <span>supercilium</span>. The underparts are pale grey and the upperparts pale brown. The folded wings are chestnut and the tail is black, tipped white. The bill is black.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, but young birds have a brown cap and a pale yellow bill. There are 14 subspecies, varying in size and the colour of the back, underparts and eyestripe.</p>
<p>Black-crowned Tchagra has a descending whistling song, <i>Chee-chee chee cheroo cheroo</i>, and can be readily tempted into sight by imitating this call, presumably because the bird is concerned that there is an intruder in its territory. The male also has a switchback display flight.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Black-crowned Tchagra lays two or three heavily marked white <span>eggs</span> in a cup nest in a tree or bush. Both sexes, but mainly the female, incubate for 12&#x2013;15 days to hatching; the chicks fledge after another 15 days.</p>
<p>It is similar in habits to the shrikes, hunting <span>insects</span> and other small prey from a perch in a bush, although it sits less conspicuously than true shrikes.</p>
