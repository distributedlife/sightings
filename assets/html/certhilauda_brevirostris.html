<p>The <b>Agulhas long-billed lark</b> (<i>Certhilauda brevirostris</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. It is an <span>endemic</span> resident breeder in the <span>Western Cape</span>, <span>South Africa</span>. Its restricted range is centred on the <span>Agulhas</span> arable farmlands, from east of the <span>Hottentots-Holland</span> mountain range to <span>Mossel Bay</span>, and occupies a maximum of 15,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;.</p>
<p>This <span>lark</span> was formerly considered as a subspecies of <span>Cape long-billed lark</span>, <i>Certhilauda curvirostris</i> until it, with three other subspecies, was elevated to species status (Sibley and Monroe 1990, 1993).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_breeding">Habitat and breeding</span></h2>
<p>The natural habitat of Agulhas long-billed lark is uncertain, since most of its range has been converted into stony wheatfields and pasture land, only 30% remaining as coastal <span>fynbos</span> or <span>karoo</span> scrub. It is endemic to South Africa. However, it appears to have adapted quite well to its modified habitats, like farmlands, although its distribution is patchy for unknown reasons. At present, very little is known about its ecology and breeding requirements. Like other larks, it nests on the ground. Its food is <span>seeds</span> and <span>insects</span>, the latter especially in the breeding season.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>The Agulhas long-billed lark is 18&#x2013;20&#xA0;cm in length. It is long-tailed and has a longish curved bill. It has a streaked buff-grey head and back, and the closed wings are grey. The underparts are cream-coloured with dark streaking on the breast and flanks. Compared to Cape long-billed lark, this species more buff and has a shorter tail and bill.</p>
<p>The display song of Algulhas long-billed lark is a disyllabic whistle <i>seeooo seeeooo</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>This species is listed as Near Threatened, since the total population is unknown. However, its true status and the nature of any threats are currently uncertain.</p>
