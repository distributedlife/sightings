<p>The <b>bat hawk</b> (<i>Macheiramphus alcinus</i>) is a <span>raptor</span> found in <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> and south <span>Asia</span> to <span>New Guinea</span>. It is named for its diet, which consists mainly of <span>bats</span>. It requires open space in which to hunt, but will live anywhere from dense <span>rainforest</span> to semi-arid <span>veld</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The bat hawk is a slender, medium-sized <span>bird of prey</span>, usually about 45&#xA0;cm long. It has long wings and a <span>falconine</span> silhouette. Adults are dark brown or black, with a white patch on the throat and chest, and have a white streak above and below each eye. Juveniles are mottled brown and have more white <span>plumage</span> than adults.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hunting">Hunting</span></h3>
<p>Bats are the usual prey of the bat hawk, although they may eat small <span>birds</span>, such as <span>swallows</span>, <span>swifts</span>, and <span>nightjars</span>, or even <span>insects</span>. They hunt by chasing their prey at high speeds in flight. About 49% of their hunts are successful.</p>
<p>The bat hawk is <span>crepuscular</span> and hunts at dusk.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p><span>Courtship</span> involves many aerial displays and stunts. The nest is built with sticks gathered in flight, and is about 90&#xA0;cm across and 30&#xA0;cm deep. The female is solely responsible for <span>incubating</span> her clutch. The male often shares food with her. About a month after incubation begins, the eggs hatch, and both parents help to feed their young. 30&#x2013;45 days after hatching, the young <span>fledge</span>. They leave the nest soon after.</p>
<p>Bat hawks breed most years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Due to its large range and relatively stable population, the bat hawk is of <span>least concern</span>.</p>
