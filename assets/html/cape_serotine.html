<p>The <b>Cape serotine</b> (<i>Neoromicia capensis</i>) is a species of <span>vesper bat</span> occurring in <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>.</p>
<p>It is found in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Benin</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Central African Republic</span>, <span>Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Ivory Coast</span>, <span>Equatorial Guinea</span>, <span>Eritrea</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Gabon</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Guinea</span>, <span>Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Liberia</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Sierra Leone</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Togo</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, and possibly <span>Djibouti</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_ecology">Habitat and ecology</span></h2>
<p>Its natural <span>habitats</span> are subtropical or tropical dry <span>forests</span>, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, dry <span>savanna</span>, and moist savanna, grassland, bushveld and Acacia woodland, and though recorded from more arid areas is absent from desert regions.</p>
<p>Animals roost in small groups of up to about 20 individuals, under the bark of trees, in hollow trees, in cracks in walls and under the eaves and roofs of houses whether thatched, tiled or covered in corrugated iron. Being unobtrusive, their presence is mostly unnoticed. They will readily occupy a bat house.</p>
<p>Small, brownish in colour with a greyish underbelly, and relatively untidy fur. Its colour is quite variable depending on the region where it occurs. Small snout and mouth, with a dome-shaped forehead. Wing membranes are dark in colour with a forearm length of some 29-38 mm with a small wingspan. Weight is between 4-10 grams. Its flying behaviour when foraging appears to be quite playful.</p>
<p>They give birth once a year to from 1-4 young between October and November. Food items include beetles, lacewings, moths, mosquitoes, plant-sucking bugs and a variety of other flying insects. </p>
<p>A close relative of human <span>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</span> has been found in the nucleotide sequence of <i>Neoromicia zuluensis</i>. </p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p><i>There is increasing evidence that bats are the origin of many <span>coronaviruses</span> which they pass on to an intermediate host, and then on to humans. For example, Australian bats can transmit the <span>hendra virus</span> to horses, which in turn pass it on to humans. This should not be seen as an excuse to get rid of bats. The public is generally advised against handling them because they carry a lot of diseases, but they should cherish them for the services they provide.</i></p>
