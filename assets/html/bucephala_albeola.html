<p>The <b>bufflehead</b> (<i>Bucephala albeola</i>) is a small American <span>sea duck</span> of the genus <i>Bucephala</i>, the <span>goldeneyes</span>. This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Anas albeola</i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Bufflehead ranges from 32&#x2013;40&#xA0;cm (13&#x2013;16&#xA0;in) long and 270&#x2013;550&#xA0;g (9.5&#x2013;19.4&#xA0;oz), with the drakes larger than the females. Averaging 35.5&#xA0;cm (14.0&#xA0;in) and 370&#xA0;g (13&#xA0;oz), it rivals the <span>green-winged teal</span> as the smallest <span>American</span> duck.</p>
<p>Adult males are striking black and white, with iridescent green and purple heads with a large white patch behind the eye. Females are grey-toned with a smaller white patch behind the eye and a light underside.</p>
<p>The name bufflehead is a combination of <span>buffalo</span> and <span>head</span>, referring to the oddly bulbous head shape of the species. This is most noticeable when the male puffs out the feathers on the head, thus greatly increasing the apparent size of the head.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>They are <span>migratory</span> and most of them winter in protected coastal waters, or open inland waters, on the east and west coasts of <span>North America</span> and the southern <span>United States</span>. The Bufflehead is an extremely rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>. Their breeding habitat is wooded lakes and ponds in <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Canada</span>, almost entirely included in the boreal forest or <span>taiga</span> habitat.</p>

<p>Buffleheads have evolved their small size in order to fit the nesting cavity of their "metabiotic" host, a woodpecker, the <span>northern flicker</span>. Due to their small size, they are highly active, undertaking dives almost continuously while sustained by their high metabolism. They do not tend to collect in large flocks; groups are usually limited to small numbers. One duck will serve as a sentry, watching for predators as the others in the group dive in search of food. Buffleheads are amongst the last waterfowl to leave their breeding grounds and one of the world's most punctual migrants, arriving on their wintering grounds within a narrow margin of time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Buffleheads are monogamous, and the females return to the same breeding site, year after year. They nest in cavities in trees, primarily aspens or poplars, using mostly old <span>flicker</span> nests, close (usually &lt; 25&#xA0;m (82&#xA0;ft)) to water. Nest competitors include <span>mountain bluebird</span> (<i>Sialia currucoides</i>), <span>tree swallow</span> (<i>Tachycineta bicolor</i>), and <span>European starling</span>. There was one recorded instance of a female <span>Barrow's goldeneye</span> killing a bufflehead adult female and her brood. Smaller cavities are preferred because of less competition with the larger <span>goldeneyes</span>. Females may be killed on the nest by mammals, such as <span>weasels</span> (<i>Mustela</i> spp.) or <span>mink</span> (<i>Mustela vison</i>), and by goldeneyes over nest competition.</p>
<p>Average clutch size is 9 (range 6&#x2013;11), and eggs average 50.5 by 36.3&#xA0;mm (1.99 by 1.43&#xA0;in). Incubation averages 30 days, and nest success is high (79% in one study) compared to ground-nesting species like the teal. A day after the last duckling hatches the brood leaps from the nest cavity. The young fledge at 50&#x2013;55 days of age. Predators of adults include the <span>peregrine falcon</span> (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>), <span>snowy owl</span> (<i>Bubo scandiacus</i>), <span>bald eagle</span> (<i>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</i>), <span>golden eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>), <span>red-tailed hawk</span> (<i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>), <span>great horned owl</span> (<i>Bubo virginianus</i>), <span>Eurasian eagle owl</span> (<i>Bubo bubo</i>), and <span>Cooper's hawk</span> (<i>Accipiter cooperii</i>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>These diving birds forage underwater. They prefer water depths of 1.2&#x2013;4.5&#xA0;m (3.9&#x2013;14.8&#xA0;ft). In freshwater habitats they eat primarily <span>insects</span>, and in saltwater they feed predominantly on <span>crustaceans</span> and <span>mollusks</span>. Aquatic <span>plants</span> and <span>fish</span> eggs can often become locally important food items as well.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_with_humans">Relationship with humans</span></h2>
<p>Because of their striking plumage, highly active nature and their proximity to humans on waterfront properties, buffleheads are one of the most popular birds amongst bird watchers. The bufflehead, also known as the spirit duck, was added to the Coat of Arms of the Town of Sidney, BC, in 1995. Buffleheads are hunted and are considered a gamebird. In contrast to many other seaducks that have declined in recent decades, bufflehead numbers have remained relatively constant. Habitat degradation is the major threat to this bird, since they depend on very limited coastal habitat on their wintering grounds, and very specific habitat in their boreal breeding grounds. Although buffleheads do use man-made nest boxes, they still need the forest habitat to thrive.</p>
