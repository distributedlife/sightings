<p>The <b>grey petrel</b> (<i>Procellaria cinerea</i>), also called the <b>brown petrel</b>, <b>pediunker</b> or <b>grey shearwater</b> is a species of <span>seabird</span> in the <span>Procellariidae</span>, or <span>petrel</span> <span>family</span>. It occurs in the open seas of the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span>, mainly between 49&#xB0;S and 32&#xB0;S.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The grey petrel is a member of the <span>Procellaria</span> <span>genus</span>, and in turn is member of the <span>Procellariidae</span> family, and the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>. As a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the petrel are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<p>The grey petrel has been called the pediunker, grey shearwater, and brown petrel.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Procellaria</i> comes from two <span>Latin</span> words, <i>procella</i> meaning "storm" and <i>arius</i> a suffix meaning "pertaining to". This is in reference to their association with stormy weather. The word <i>petrel</i> is derived from <span>Saint Peter</span> and the story of his walking on water. This is in reference to the petrels' habit of appearing to run on the water to take off.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The grey petrel is a large grey, white, and brown <span>petrel</span>. They average 48&#xA0;cm (19&#xA0;in) in length and weigh 1,000&#xA0;g (35&#xA0;oz). They have brownish-grey <span>mantle</span>, back, uppertail coverts, and upperwings. They have a white belly, and underwings and under-tail that are ash-grey. They have a yellow-green <span>bill</span> and a pink-grey feet.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Grey petrels return to their breeding grounds in February and March and build a <span>burrow</span> for a nest. These burrows are on well-drained ground, overrun with <i><span>Poa</span></i> tussock grass, typically on steep terrain. By late March or early April, they lay their one <span>egg</span>, with both birds <span>incubating</span> it. After hatching, the chick is cared for by both birds until it <span>fledges</span> between late September and early December.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>They will dive from heights up to 10&#xA0;m (33&#xA0;ft) when getting food. It breeds on <span>Tristan da Cunha</span>, <span>Gough Island</span>, the <span>Prince Edward Islands</span>, <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, <span>Macquarie Island</span> and on <span>New Zealand</span>'s <span>Campbell</span> and <span>Antipodes Islands</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Grey petrels are pelagic and typically stay between 49&#xB0;S and 32&#xB0;S during the non-breeding season. During the breeding season, they form <span>colonies</span> on several islands. <span>Antipodes Island</span>, with an estimate of 53,000 pairs, and <span>Gough Island</span> with 10,000 pairs are the biggest colonies, with others on <span>Prince Edward Island</span>, <span>Marion Island</span>, <span>Tristan da Cunha</span>, <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, <span>Amsterdam Island</span>, <span>Campbell Island</span>, and <span>Macquarie Island</span>. They have an occurrence range of 68,800,000&#xA0;km (26,563,829&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>There is not a lot of recent information about this bird, but its population is believed to be shrinking slowly or possibly rapidly. Introduced <span>predators</span> such as <span>cats</span>, <span>brown</span> and <span>black</span> rats are contributing to the decline, as well as <span>longline fishing</span>, which is a major problem. This bird is the most commonly caught <span>bycatch</span> by longline fisheries in <span>New Zealand</span> waters, with one estimate at 45,000 birds in the last 20 years. Other predators are the <span>weka</span> and <span>house mouse</span>.</p>
<p>To assist in maintaining or increasing its population, it has been placed on <span>CMS Appendix II</span>, and <span>ACAP Annex1</span>. <span>Gough Island</span> has been designated as a <span>World Heritage Site</span>. <span>Antipodes Island</span> has had preliminary work done to start long term monitoring, and in 2007 the monitoring started. In 2001, brown rats were eradicated from Campbell Island, and in 2006, <span>SEAFO</span> tightened longline fishing regulations.</p>
<p>In the future, numerous tasks are planned, starting with a census on all the breeding locations. Also, studies on <span>Gough Island</span> pertaining to <span>house mice</span>, and finally, stricter fishing regulations enforced by <span>FAO</span>, <span>RFMO</span>, and <span>ACAP</span>.</p>
