<p>The <b>white-necked petrel</b> (<i>Pterodroma cervicalis</i>), also known as the <b>white-naped petrel</b>, is a species of <span>seabird</span> in the <span>Procellariidae</span> family. During the non-breeding season it occurs throughout a large part of the <span>Pacific</span>, but it is only known to breed on <span>Macauley Island</span> in <span>New Zealand's</span> <span>Kermadec Islands</span> and the <span>Australian</span> territory of <span>Norfolk Island</span> and <span>Phillip Island</span>. It formerly bred on <span>Raoul Island</span>, but has now been <span>extirpated</span> from this locality. Reports of breeding on <span>Merelava</span>, <span>Vanuatu</span>, are more likely to be the very similar <span>Vanuatu petrel</span>, <i>P. occulta</i>, which some consider to be a <span>subspecies</span> of the white-necked petrel. The <span>IUCN</span> rating as <span>vulnerable</span> is for the "combined" species.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This species resembles the Vanuatu petrel, <i>P. occulta</i>, but is slightly larger at 43 centimetres (17&#xA0;in) in length, 95&#x2013;105 centimetres (37&#x2013;41&#xA0;in) in wing span and 380&#x2013;545 grams (13.4&#x2013;19.2&#xA0;oz) in weight. It has a black cap, white rear neck, dark grey back, wings and tail, and a darker rump. The underparts are white with dark bases on the primary feathers. The upperparts of worn birds become darker.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to separate the white-necked petrel from the Vanuatu petrel at sea.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>This is a solitary pelagic <span>gadfly petrel</span> of the open seas of the south-west <span>Pacific</span>. It has an effortless graceful flight with few wing beats, and does not follow ships. It feeds on the wing, picking fish and squid from near the surface.</p>
<p>Its natural <span>habitats</span> are subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland <span>grassland</span> (for breeding) and open <span>seas</span> (for foraging). It is threatened by <span>habitat loss</span> on its breeding grounds.</p>
