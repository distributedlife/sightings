<p>The <b>Zitting Cisticola</b> or <b>Streaked Fantail Warbler</b> (<i>Cisticola juncidis</i>), is widely distributed <span>Old World warbler</span> whose breeding range includes southern <span>Europe</span>, <span>Africa</span> (outside the deserts and rainforest), and southern <span>Asia</span> down to northern <span>Australia</span>. A small bird found mainly in grasslands, it is best identified by its rufous rump, lacks any gold on the collar and the brownish tail is tipped with white. During the breeding season, males have a zigzagging flight display accompanied by regular "zitting" calls that has been likened to repeated snips of a scissor. They build their pouch nest suspended within a clump of grass.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Zitting Cisticola is brown above, heavily streaked with black markings. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, white-tipped and flicked frequently, giving rise to the alternative name for the species. The adult males have less crown streaking and more back marking than the females, but there are no great difference between the sexes or the eighteen geographical races. The absence of a nuchal collar separate it from <i>Cisticola exilis</i>. In the non-breeding season, they tend to skulk within the grass and can be hard to spot.</p>

<p>Across their wide distribution range, several variations in populations have been noted and as many as 18 subspecies are recognized. They differ slightly in calls, plumage and size and some have been considered full species in some taxonomic treatments. The nominate form is found in southern France, Greece, Turkey, Sicily, Corsica and Egypt while western Portugal and Spain have <i>cisticola</i>. The population in Israel, Syria, Iraq and Iran is <i>neuroticus</i> while the northern and eastern African population is <i>uropygialis</i> and <i>perennius</i> (further south). Gabon, Angola, and southern Africa are home to <i>terrestris</i>. The population in the Western Ghats of India, <i>salimalii</i>, does not show seasonal tail length variation as in <i>cursitans</i> of the plains of India and dry-zone of Sri Lanka, which has a longer tail in the non-breeding season. Population <i>malaya</i> is found in southern Southeast Asia, <i>tinnabulans</i> further north in southern China while <i>brunniceps</i> is found in Korea and Japan. Other populations include <i>nigrostriatus</i> (Philippines), <i>constans</i> (Sulawesi), <i>fuscicapilla</i> (east Java), <i>leanyeri</i> (northern Australia), <i>normani</i> (northwest Queensland) and <i>laveryi</i> (northeast Australia).</p>
<p>This genus is sometimes split off with various other southern warbler genera and given family status as the Cisticolidae. This species was previously known as <b>Fan-tailed Warbler</b>, but the current name gives consistency with the many tropical cisticola species, and avoids confusion with an American species also named <span>Fan-tailed Warbler</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_distribution">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>
<p>This species is found mainly in grassland habitats, often near water. Most populations are resident, but some East Asian populations <span>migrate</span> south to warmer areas in winter. In the Himalayas, they ascent to about 1,900&#xA0;m (6,200&#xA0;ft) during summer but are below 1,300&#xA0;m (4,300&#xA0;ft) in the winter. This species is a rare vagrant to northern <span>Europe</span>, mostly as a spring overshoot. Its European range is generally expanding, although northern populations are especially susceptible to hard winters.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Zitting Cisticolas are very small insectivorous <span>birds</span>, sometimes found in small groups. The breeding season is associated with the rains. Two broods a year occur in many regions. Males are polygynous but some are monogamous the male builds the initial nest structure deep in the grasses, and invites females using a special display. Females that accept the male complete the nest. The nest is made by binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The Zitting Cisticola's nest is a cup shape with a canopy of tied-together leaves or grasses overhead for camouflage; 3&#x2013;6 eggs are laid. The female incubates the egg. The eggs hatch after about 10 days. More than one brood may be raised. Females change their mates frequently and rarely stay within the same territory, while males are less mobile. Females can sometimes breed in their first year.</p>
