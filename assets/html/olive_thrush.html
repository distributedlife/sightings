<p>The <b>olive thrush</b> (<i>Turdus olivaceus</i>) is, in its range, one of the most common members of the <span>thrush</span> family (<span>Turdidae</span>). It occurs in east <span>African</span> highlands from <span>Eritrea</span> and <span>Ethiopia</span> in north to the <span>Cape of Good Hope</span> in south. It is a bird of forest and woodland, but has locally adapted to parks and large gardens in suburban areas.</p>
<p>It can reach a length of 24&#xA0;cm and a mass of at least 101&#xA0;grams. The tail and the upperparts are coloured dull olive brown. The belly is white and the rest of the underparts have an orange hue. The throat is speckled with white spots. It can be found in evergreen forests, parks, and gardens. Its diet consists of <span>earthworms</span>, <span>insects</span>, <span>snails</span>, <span>fruits</span>, and <span>spiders</span>.</p>
<p>In southern Africa alone, there are five <span>subspecies</span> which differ mainly in the relative amounts of white, orange and brown on the underparts: <i>T. o. swynnertoni</i>, <i>T. o. transvaalensis</i>, <i>T. o. olivaceus</i>, <i>T. o. pondonensis</i>, and <i>T. o. culminans</i>. The <span>Karoo thrush</span> (<i>Turdus smithi</i>), the <span>Somali thrush</span> (<i>Turdus ludoviciae</i>) and the <span>Taita thrush</span> (<i>Turdus helleri</i>) are variously included as <span>subspecies</span> of the olive thrush or considered separate species, of which the last is <span>critically endangered</span>. Additionally, the <span>taxa</span> from the northern part of its range are sometimes regarded as one (Northern olive thrush or mountain thrush, <i>T. abyssinicus</i>) or several separate species (<span>Abyssinian thrush</span>, <i>T. abyssinicus</i>, and <span>Usambara thrush</span>, <i>T. roehli</i>).</p>
<p>The female builds a cup <span>nest</span>, typically 2 to 9 m above the ground in a tree or hedge. The 1&#x2013;3 (usually 2) <span>eggs</span> are incubated solely by the female for 14&#x2013;15 days to hatching, and the chicks fledge in another 16 days.</p>
<p>The male's song is a mix of fluted, whistled and trilled phrases, which varies geographically. It occasionally <span>mimics</span> other birds.</p>
