<p><b>Gray's grasshopper warbler</b> (<i>Locustella fasciolata</i>), also known as <b>Gray's warbler</b>, is a species of <span>grass warbler</span> in the <span>family</span> <span>Locustellidae</span>; it was formerly included in the "<span>Old World warbler</span>" assemblage.</p>
<p>The <span>Sakhalin grasshopper warbler</span> was formerly considered conspecific.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>This small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> breeds from western <span>Siberia</span> and <span>Korea</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in southeast <span>Asia</span>. It is a species found in lowland and coastal regions, nesting in forests or thickets.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This is the largest of all the <i>Locustella</i> warblers, approaching the size of the <span>great reed warbler</span>. The adult has an unstreaked olive-brown back, uniformly grey breast and buff underparts, with unmottled dull orange under tail-coverts.</p>
<p>The song is a short phrase, loud and distinctive; nothing like the <span>insect</span>-like reeling of European <i>Locustella</i> species, and more musical than that of <span>Pallas's grasshopper warbler</span>.</p>
