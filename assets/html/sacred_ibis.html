<p>This bird is usually silent, but occasionally makes some croaking noises, unlike its vocal relative, the <span>Hadada ibis</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_distribution">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>
<p>A wading <span>bird</span> of the <span>ibis</span> family, <b>Threskiornithidae</b>, the sacred ibis breeds in <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>, southeastern <span>Iraq</span>, and formerly in <span>Egypt</span>, where it was venerated and often mummified as a symbol of the god <span>Thoth</span>. The African sacred ibis occurs in marshy wetlands and mud flats, both inland and on the coast. It will also visit cultivation and <span>rubbish dumps</span>.</p>

<p>The bird nests in tree colonies, often with other large wading birds such as <span>herons</span>. It builds a stick nest often in a <span>baobab tree</span> and lays two or three <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>It feeds on various <span>fish</span>, <span>frogs</span>, small mammals, reptiles and smaller birds as well as <span>insects</span>. It may also probe into the soil with its long <span>bill</span> for invertebrates such as <span>earthworms</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="As_an_introduced_species">As an introduced species</span></h2>
<p>The African sacred ibis has been introduced into <span>France</span>, <span>Italy</span>, <span>Spain</span>, <span>Taiwan</span>, and the United States (south Florida).</p>
<p>The introduced and rapidly growing populations in southern Europe are seen as a potential problem, since these large <span>predators</span> can devastate breeding colonies of species such as <span>terns</span>. They also compete successfully for nest sites with <span>cattle</span> and <span>little egrets</span>. The adaptable ibises supplement their diet by feeding at rubbish tips, which helps them to survive the winter in these <span>temperate</span> regions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The African sacred ibis is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>

<p>Venerated and often mummified by <span>Ancient Egyptians</span> as a symbol of the god <span>Thoth</span>, the ibis was, according to <span>Herodotus</span> and <span>Pliny the Elder</span>, also invoked against incursions of winged serpents. Herodotus wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>There is a region moreover in Arabia, situated nearly over against the city of Buto, to which place I came to inquire about the winged serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in quantity so great that it is impossible to make report of the number, and there were heaps of spines, some heaps large and others less large and others smaller still than these, and these heaps were many in number.</p>
<p>The region in which the spines are scattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain, which plain adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards Egypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance of this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but kill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians) that the ibis has come to be greatly honored by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians also agree that it is for this reason that they honor these birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In more mythical stories, it was also said that the flies that brought pestilence died immediately upon propitiatory sacrifices of this bird.</p>
