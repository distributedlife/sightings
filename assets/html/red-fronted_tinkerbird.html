<p>The <b>red-fronted tinkerbird</b>, <i><span>Pogoniulus</span> pusillus</i> formerly known as the <b>red-fronted tinker barbet</b> is a small <span>African barbet</span>. Barbets are <span>near passerine</span> birds with bristles around the base of the bill. They have a world-wide tropical distribution.</p>
<p>The red-fronted tinkerbird is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in eastern <span>South Africa</span>, with a separate population from southern <span>Sudan</span> and <span>Ethiopia</span> south to central and eastern <span>Tanzania</span>. It is sometimes considered conspecific with its northern counterpart, the <span>yellow-fronted tinkerbird</span>, <i>Pogoniulus chrysoconus</i>.</p>
<p>The red-fronted tinkerbird is associated with <span>juniper</span> forest and scrub. It nests in a tree hole and lays two or three eggs. It eats berries and fruit, particularly <span>mistletoe</span>, but also takes insects as it forages in deep cover.</p>
<p>The red-fronted tinkerbird is 9&#x2013;10.5&#xA0;cm (3.5&#x2013;4.1&#xA0;in) in length. It is a plump bird, with a short neck, large head, and short tail. The adult has black upperparts heavlly streaked with yellow and white, and a golden wing patch. Its head has a strong black and white pattern, with a red forecrown spot. Its underparts and rump are lemon yellow. Sexes are similar in appearance, but young birds lack the red forehead.</p>
<p>This species is distinguished from the yellow-fronted tinkerbird by the colour of the forehead spot, the golden wing patch, and its overall darker appearance. It is often confused with the <span>red-fronted barbet</span>, but it is significantly smaller than that species, has a black moustache and a less robust bill, and lacks a broad yellow <span>superciliary stripe</span>.</p>
<p>At about 100 repetitions per minute, the red-fronted tinkerbird's call is a fast <i>tink-tink-tink-tink</i>, very similar to that of the yellow-fronted tinkerbird. Many barbets perch prominently, but unlike their larger relatives, the smaller tinkerbirds sing from cover and are more frequently heard than seen.</p>
