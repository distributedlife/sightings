In 2002, the <span>IUCN</span> listed the caracal as <span>Least Concern</span>, as it is widespread and relatively common. The felid is considered threatened in <span>North Africa</span>, and rare in the central Asian republics and India.</p>
<p>German naturalist <span>Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber</span> first described <i>Felis caracal</i> in 1776 from a specimen collected from <span>Table Mountain</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, which is considered the <span>type locality</span> of the <span>species</span>. The <span>generic name</span> <i>Caracal</i> was first used by the British naturalist <span>John Edward Gray</span> in 1843 on the basis of a <span>type specimen</span> collected near the <span>Cape of Good Hope</span>.</p>
<p>The caracal has been classified variously with <i><span>Lynx</span></i> and <i><span>Felis</span></i> in the past, but <span>molecular</span> evidence supports a <span>monophyletic</span> genus closely allied with the <span>African golden cat</span> and <span>serval</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The caracal is distinguished from <i>Felis</i> by the presence of a long tuft on the tip of the <span>ears</span>, exceeding half their length. No trace of pattern remains in the coat, except a few spots on the underside and inside of the fore legs. It is a slender, long-legged cat of medium size with a relatively short <span>tail</span>. The <span>fur</span> on the back and sides is generally of a uniform tawny grey or reddish, frosted-sand colour. The belly and the undersides of the legs and chest are whitish and spotted or blotched with pale markings. The tufted ears are black-backed. <span>Black</span> caracals also occur. The <span>skull</span> is high and rounded. The jaw is short, stoutly built, and equipped with large, powerful teeth. About 92% of caracals lack the second upper <span>premolar</span> teeth. Males reach a head and body length of 75 to 105.7&#xA0;cm (29.5 to 41.6&#xA0;in), with a 23.1- to 34-cm-long tail, and weigh 8.0 to 20&#xA0;kg (17.6 to 44.1&#xA0;lb). Females are smaller with a head and body length of 69 to 102.9&#xA0;cm (27.2 to 40.5&#xA0;in) and a tail 19.5 to 34&#xA0;cm (7.7 to 13.4&#xA0;in) long. They weigh from 7.0 to 15.9&#xA0;kg (15.4 to 35.1&#xA0;lb).</p>
<p>Facial markings comprise a dark line running down the center of the forehead to near the nose, and another one running from the inner edge of the <span>eye</span> to the nostrils. The <span>pupils</span> of the eyes contract to form circles. A light-colored ring encircles the eyes, and a rather indistinct dark brown patch occurs over each eye. White patches occur on either side of the nose. The inner surface of the <span>pinna</span> is covered with small white hairs. Numerous stiff hairs emerge from between the <span>pads</span> and probably are an adaption for moving through soft sand.</p>

<p>Caracals are common in parts of their sub-Saharan range, especially in <span>South Africa</span> and southern <span>Namibia</span>, where they expand into new, and recolonize vacant, areas. They occur at much lower densities in <span>Central</span> and <span>West Africa</span>, where the <span>carnivore</span> community is more diverse. They occupy a wide variety of habitats from <span>semidesert</span> to relatively open <span>savanna</span> and <span>scrubland</span> to moist woodland and thicket or <span>evergreen</span> and montane forest such as in the <span>Western Cape</span> of South Africa. They prefer drier woodland and savanna regions with lower rainfall and some cover. They also occur in the <span>Saharan</span> mountain ranges and semiarid woodlands. On the <span>Arabian Peninsula</span>, caracals occur throughout the mountain ranges and hilly steppe regions, but probably do not penetrate far into the great sand deserts of the interior.</p>
<p>The <span>Caspian Sea</span>, <span>Ustyurt</span>, and the <span>Aral Sea</span> constitute the northern distribution limit of caracals, which barely extends east of the <span>Amu Darya</span>. In <span>Turkmenia</span>, caracals were known from the coastal plains at the mouth of the <span>Atrek River</span> to the foothills of the <span>Kopet-Dag</span>, along the <span>Tedzhen River</span>, in the deserts along the <span>Murghab River</span> and east of the <span>Kushka River</span>. Their range extends southeastwards from <span>Iran</span>, through Pakistan and central India as far as <span>Uttar Pradesh</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_of_subspecies">Distribution of subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Subsequent to Schreber's first description of a caracal from South Africa, several subspecies were described, of which these are recognized today:</p>

<p>Russian zoologist Heptner described <i>C. c. micha&#xEB;lis</i> in 1945 from the western <span>Karakum</span>.</p>

<p>Adult caracals are solitary, but have also been observed in pairs. They produce the usual range of sounds for cats, including growling, hissing, purring, and calling. Unusually, they also make a barking sound, which is possibly used as a warning. They <span>scent mark</span> their territory, leave <span>faeces</span> in visible locations, and mark territory by <span>spraying urine</span> onto bushes or logs, or raking it into the ground with their hind feet.</p>
<p>Their home ranges are large in arid areas. Three males averaged 316.4&#xA0;km (122.2&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) on Namibian ranchland. In northern <span>Saudi Arabia</span>, a <span>radio-tracked</span> male ranged over 270 to 1,116&#xA0;km (104 to 431&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) in different seasons. In an agricultural area in <span>Israel</span>'s <span>Negev Desert</span>, male home ranges averaged 220.6&#xA0;km (85.2&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). Home range size was positively correlated with body weight, and negatively correlated with prey availability. Male home ranges overlapped substantially (50%), and typically included those of several females. Two dispersals were observed: a male migrated 60 to 90&#xA0;km (37 to 56&#xA0;mi) south before establishing a home range, whereas a female remained in the vicinity of her natal range, with her range partly overlapping that of her mother. Twenty caracals, several of them transients, were found to use an area of 100&#xA0;km (39&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) with some ranging outside this area, making for a relatively high local density despite the large home ranges. Male home ranges in better-watered environments of South Africa are smaller. In the <span>West Coast National Park</span>, South Africa, home ranges of two males averaged 26.9&#xA0;km (10.4&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi), and those of three females 7.39&#xA0;km (2.85&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). Male home ranges overlapped completely with those of females, whereas female ranges overlapped between zero and 19%. Caracal were active by night and day, and significantly longer on nights colder than 20&#xB0;C. Males moved more than twice the distance of females during an active period.</p>
<p>Caracals can survive without drinking for a long period&#x2014;their water demand is satisfied with the body fluids of prey. They are known for their ability to capture <span>birds</span> by leaping 2&#xA0;m (6.6&#xA0;ft) or more into the air from a standing start. They hunt by stalking their prey, approaching within about 5&#xA0;m (16&#xA0;ft) before suddenly sprinting. They kill smaller prey with a bite to the nape of the neck, and larger animals by biting the throat and then raking with their claws. They sometimes cover larger prey if they cannot consume the whole carcass in a single meal, and return to it later. Some have even been observed to hide carcasses in trees. They live mainly on prey smaller than 5&#xA0;kg (11&#xA0;lb), including <span>hyraxes</span>, <span>springhares</span>, <span>gerbils</span>, <span>mice</span>, and birds. They are capable of taking <span>antelopes</span>, including species such as <span>mountain reedbuck</span>, <span>springbok</span>, <span>common duiker</span>, and <span>steenbok</span>. Occasionally, they tackle adult <span>goitered gazelle</span>.</p>

<p>Mating occurs year round. In the Sahara, breeding is reported to occur primarily in midwinter. <span>Estrus</span> lasts 5&#x2013;6 days. Females copulate with several males in a "pecking order" which is related to the age and size of the male. One female was found to have mated with three different males during every estrous period, each time the same individuals in the same sequence. In some areas, males have been observed to fight aggressively for access to females and to remain with one for several days to guard against rivals; in others, they appear to be less protective. Copulation can last from 90 seconds to 10 minutes.</p>
<p><span>Gestation</span> lasts from 69 to 81 days, and litter size ranges from one to six kittens. Females use caves, tree cavities, or burrows as shelter when giving birth. Newborn kittens weigh 198 to 250&#xA0;g (7.0 to 8.8&#xA0;oz), and open their eyes between four and 10 days of age. Kittens venture outside the birthing den at around one month of age. Their <span>deciduous teeth</span> are fully developed at the age of 50 days. They are weaned at about 10 weeks. At around four or five months, the <span>canine teeth</span> appear, with the others following over the next six months. The young stay with their mother for up to one year, when they start to reach <span>sexual maturity</span>. In captivity, they have lived to be 16 years old.</p>
<p>In 1998, a caracal was <span>hybridised</span> with a <span>domestic cat</span> at the <span>Moscow Zoo</span>.</p>

<p>Habitat destruction due to <span>agriculture</span> and <span>desertification</span> is a significant threat in central, west, north, and northeast Africa where caracals are naturally sparsely distributed. It is also likely to be the main threat in the Asian part of its range. As caracals are capable of taking small domestic livestock, they are often subject to persecution. Severity of depredation appears to be dependent on the availability of wild prey and husbandry techniques.</p>
<p>In Iran, the killing of small livestock has brought the caracal into serious conflict with local people, who sometimes make efforts to eradicate it. The cat has never been recorded to be killed in road incidents, and no severe poaching pressure on it appears to happen.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Populations in Asian range states are included in <span>CITES Appendix I</span>; populations in African range states are included in <span>Appendix II</span>. Hunting of the species is prohibited in <span>Afghanistan</span>, Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, <span>Kazakhstan</span>, <span>Lebanon</span>, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, <span>Tajikistan</span>, Tunisia, <span>Turkey</span>, <span>Turkmenistan</span>, and <span>Uzbekistan</span>. In sub-Saharan Africa, the caracal is protected from hunting in about half of its range states. In Namibia and South Africa, the caracal is classified as a "problem animal", which permits landowners to kill the species without restriction; nonetheless, caracal have persisted and remain widespread.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_captivity">In captivity</span></h3>
<p>As of November 2009, 18 caracals were kept in 12 <span>AZA</span>-accredited institutions participating in the Population Management Plan.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word 'caracal' is derived from the <span>Turkish</span> words <i>kara kulak</i>, which means "black ear". In <span>Persian</span>, the caracal is known as <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">&#x633;&#x6CC;&#x627;&#x647;&#x200C;&#x6AF;&#x648;&#x634;</span> <i>siy&#x101;h-g&#x14D;sh</i>, also meaning "black ear". In <span>North India</span>, it is known as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">&#x938;&#x94D;&#x92F;&#x93E;&#x939;&#x917;&#x94B;&#x936;</span> <i>syahgosh</i>.</p>
<p>It is also called African lynx, Asian lynx, and desert lynx, though it is not a member of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Lynx</span></i>.</p>
<p>The local <span>Toubou</span> name is <i>ngam ouidenanga</i>, meaning gazelle cat. In <span>Afrikaans</span>, it is called <i><span>rooikat</span></i>, which means red cat.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_culture">In culture</span></h2>
<p>Caracals appear to have held some religious significance for the ancient <span>Egyptians</span>. They were found in wall paintings, their bodies embalmed, and sculptures of caracals and other cats guarded tombs.</p>
<p>Historically, caracals have been used in India for <span>hunting</span> and blood sports. A popular sport in India was to have a captive caracal set upon a flock of <span>pigeons</span>, whereupon bets were made on how many birds could be taken down by the cat. A practised caracal could ground as many as a dozen birds. Today, as well as in the past, caracals have occasionally been kept as <span>exotic pets</span> in Africa, India, <span>North America</span>, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The <span>Caracal Battalion</span> is a unique combat unit in the <span>Israel Defense Forces</span>. About two-thirds of the battalion soldiers are women and their main role is to prevent infiltration on the southern borders of Israel.</p>
