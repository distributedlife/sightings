<p>The <b>Martial Eagle</b> (<i>Polemaetus bellicosus</i>) is a large <span>eagle</span> found in open and semi-open habitats of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. It is the <span>only member</span> of the <span>genus</span> <i><b>Polemaetus</b>.</i></p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Martial Eagle is a very large eagle, with a length of 78&#x2013;96&#xA0;cm (31&#x2013;38&#xA0;in), weight of 3&#x2013;6.2&#xA0;kg (6.6&#x2013;13.7&#xA0;lb) and a <span>wingspan</span> of 188&#x2013;260&#xA0;cm (6&#xA0;ft 2&#xA0;in&#x2013;8&#xA0;ft 6&#xA0;in). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 56&#x2013;67.5&#xA0;cm (22.0&#x2013;26.6&#xA0;in), the tail is 27.2&#x2013;32&#xA0;cm (10.7&#x2013;12.6&#xA0;in), the <span>tarsus</span> is 9.7&#x2013;13&#xA0;cm (3.8&#x2013;5.1&#xA0;in). This is the largest eagle in <span>Africa</span> and is the fifth heaviest (on average) eagle in the world.</p>
<p>The adult's <span>plumage</span> consists of dark grey-brown coloration on the upperparts, head and upper chest, with slightly lighter edging to these feathers. The body underparts are white with blackish-brown spotting. The underwing coverts are brown, with pale flight <span>feathers</span> being streaked with black. The female is usually larger and more spotted than the male. The immature is paler above, often whitish on the head and chest, and has less spotted underparts. It reaches adult plumage in its seventh year. Martial Eagles have a short erectile crest, which is often not prominent. It often perches in a quite upright position, with its long wings completely covering the tail. The bill, at 5.5&#xA0;cm (2.2&#xA0;in), is strong and the legs are feathered to the heavy, powerful feet. There are few serious identification challenges for the species. The <span>Black-chested Snake Eagle</span> is smaller, with a relatively more prominent head and white lining the flight feathers. The <span>Crowned Eagle</span>, which also regularly perches in an erect position, has distinctly shorter wings and a distinctly longer tail and, though its plumage is fairly variable, it is more scaled on the back and it has distinctive barring on the underparts and the wings. More so than any other African eagle, the Martial Eagle is often seen only in flight.</p>
<p>Martial eagles have been noted as remarkable for their extremely keen eyesight (3.0&#x2013;3.6 times human acuity). Due to this power, they can spot potential prey from a very great distance.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Martial Eagle can be found in most of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>, wherever food is abundant and the environment favourable. It is never common, but greater population densities do exist in <span>southern Africa</span>, especially in <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>South Africa</span>. Generally, these birds are more abundant in protected areas such as <span>Kruger National Park</span> and <span>Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park</span> in South Africa, or <span>Etosha National Park</span> in <span>Namibia</span>.</p>
<p>Its preferred <span>habitat</span> is open woods and woodland edges, wooded <span>savannah</span> and thornbush habitats. It is not found in dense tropical forests such as the <span>Guinean</span> and <span>Congolian forests</span>, but needs trees to nest in and to use for obstruction while hunting. In southern Africa, they have adapted to more open habitats, such as <span>semi-desert</span> and open savanna with scattered trees, wooded hillocks and, as a recent adaptation, around <span>pylons</span>. They usually seem to prefer desolate or protected areas. The territory can vary greatly in size from more than 1,000&#xA0;km (390&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) to areas where nests are less than 10&#xA0;km (6.2&#xA0;mi) distant. This disparity is due to differences in food supply.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>The Martial Eagle is one of the world's most powerful avian predators and, among African raptors, only the <span>Crowned Eagle</span> is comparable in predatory dominance. The Martial Eagle is an <span>apex predator</span>, being at the top of the avian food chain in its environment and, if in healthy condition, having no natural predators. Although the ranges of the Martial and Crowned Eagles occasionally abut each other, the species have differing habitat preferences, with the Crowned preferring denser forests as opposed to the wooded savanna preferred by the Martial Eagle, and the two are not known to compete directly. The diet of the Martial Eagle varies greatly with prey availability and can be dictated largely by opportunity. One study of the eagles in <span>Kruger National Park</span> found that 45% of their diet was made up of birds, particularly <span>game birds</span> and <span>Egyptian Geese</span>. Reptiles, especially <span>lizards</span> like <span>monitor lizards</span> and <span>snakes</span>, including <span>Cape cobras</span>, <span>boomslangs</span>, <span>puff adders</span>, both <span>green mambas</span>, and even young <span>black mambas</span> and <span>African Rock Pythons</span>, made up 38%. The remaining 17% of prey in the study were made up of mammalian prey (which is detailed below).</p>
<p>Among bird prey, Martial Eagles often choose to predate medium-sized ground-dwelling species such as <span>francolins</span>, <span>guineafowl</span> or <span>bustards</span>. Other birds predated have included young <span>Ostriches</span>, <span>storks</span>, <span>herons</span>, other <span>waterfowl</span>, <span>hornbills</span> and <span>quelea</span> flocks. At one eyrie, the remains of six <span>Spotted Eagle-Owls</span> were counted. Martial Eagle occasionally predate adult <span>Kori Bustard</span>, which are possibly the heaviest flying animal alive today. In some areas <span>mammals</span> constitute the greater part of the diet than birds or reptiles. Among regular mammal prey are <span>hares</span>, <span>hyraxes</span>, <span>mongooses</span>, <span>squirrels</span>, <span>springhares</span>, <span>rats</span>, <span>genets</span>, <span>foxes</span>, <span>baboons</span>, other <span>monkeys</span>, young <span>warthogs</span> <span>dikdiks</span>, young <span>impala</span> and various other young or small <span>antelope</span>. Large and formidable prey are not unheard of, with carnivores such as <span>caracal</span>, <span>servals</span> and <span>Black-backed Jackals</span> having been killed by this eagle. Martial Eagles have predated adult <span>duikers</span> weighing up to 37&#xA0;kg (82&#xA0;lbs), perhaps the heaviest live prey item recorded for any wild raptor. Oversized prey, being any that are notably heavier than the eagle itself, are returned to repeatedly after the kill for feeding by both members of a breeding pair, since it is too heavy to take flight with or carry in flight. However, most prey items weigh under 5&#xA0;kg (11&#xA0;lb). Martial Eagles may additionally attack domestic livestock, including <span>poultry</span>, lambs and young <span>goats</span>, but this is never a great part of the diet.</p>
<p>The Martial Eagle hunts mostly in flight, <span>circling</span> high above its territory, and stooping sharply to catch its prey by surprise. Prey may be spotted from 3 to 5 kilometers away. On occasion, they may still-hunt from a high perch or concealed in vegetation near watering holes. Unusually for a bird of its size, it may hover while hunting. Birds are typically killed on the ground or in trees, but there are records of bird prey being killed in mid-flight.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nesting">Nesting</span></h2>
<p>Martial Eagles may breed in various months in different parts of their range. The mating season is in November through April in <span>Senegal</span>, January to June in <span>Sudan</span>, August to July in northeast Africa and almost any month in eastern Africa, though mostly in April&#x2013;November. Martial Eagles have been thought to have no distinctive display flight, but they do engage in a subtle one, with the males flying mildly around in circles. Rarely, the female joins him and the pair grasp talons with each other. During the breeding season, these typically silent birds utter a loud <span>cry</span> <i>klee-klee-klee-kloeee-kloeee-kuleee</i>. They build their nests in large trees, often placing them in the main fork of tree at 6&#x2013;20&#xA0;m (20&#x2013;66&#xA0;ft) off the ground, though nests have been recorded from 5 to 70&#xA0;m (16 to 230&#xA0;ft) high, in the highest cases on top of the tree canopy. Often trees used are on the sides of cliffs, ridges, valley or hilltop, with one nest having been found within a cave. In the <span>karoo</span> of <span>South Africa</span>, they have also nested on electric-power pylons. The nest is a huge construction of sticks. In the first year of construction, the nest is 1.2 to 1.5&#xA0;m (3.9 to 4.9&#xA0;ft) in <span>diameter</span> and 0.6&#xA0;m (2.0&#xA0;ft) deep. After regular use over several years, the nests can regularly measure in excess of 2&#xA0;m (6.6&#xA0;ft) in both diameter and depth. Martial Eagles have a slow breeding rate, laying usually one <span>egg</span> (rarely two) every two years. The egg is incubated for 45 to 53 days and the chick fledged at 96 to 104 days. Despite increasing signs of independence (such as flight and beginning to practice hunting), juvenile birds will remain in the care of their parents for a further 6 to 12 months. Due to this long dependence period, these eagles can usually only mate in alternate years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_issues">Conservation issues</span></h2>
<p>The Martial Eagle is probably naturally scarce, due to its requirement for large territories and low reproductive rates. However, the species has been experiencing a major decline in numbers in recent years, due largely to being directly killed by humans. Its <span>conservation status</span> was uplisted to <span>Near Threatened</span> in 2009 and to <span>Vulnerable</span> in 2013 and another uplisting is already expected. In many areas where they come into contact with humans, eagle populations have decreased greatly through persecution via shooting and poisoning. The reasoning behind such persecution is that Martial Eagles are taken as a predatory threat to livestock. Despite this perception, in reality domestic animals constitute only a small proportion of the species' diet, whereas the presence of eagles is a sure sign of a healthy environment. Indirect threats, such as collision with power-lines, are also a common modern problem for Martial Eagles. Another hazard is caused by steep sided farm reservoirs, in which many birds drown. In South Africa, this eagle may have lost 20% of its population in the last three generations due to such collisions. Further excerbating the problems faced by the Martial Eagle, habitat destruction and reduction of prey continues to occur at a high rate outside of protected areas. The preservation of this species depends on education of farmers, and the increase of protected areas where the species can nest and hunt.</p>
