<p>The <b>Aleutian tern</b> (<i>Onychoprion aleuticus</i>, formerly <i>Sterna aleutica</i> - see Bridge <i>et al.</i>, 2005) is a <span>seabird</span> of the <span>tern</span> family Sternidae.</p>
<p>This species breeds in colonies on coasts and islands in <span>Alaska</span> and easternmost <span>Siberia</span>. It is strongly <span>migratory</span>, wintering off <span>Indonesia</span> and <span>Malaysia</span>. Large numbers appear off <span>China</span> during passage periods.</p>
<p>It is a very rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>, with just one record, on the <span>Farne Islands</span> off <span>Northumberland</span>, <span>England</span> on 28&#x2013;29 May 1979.</p>
<p>It lays 2-3 eggs in a ground scrape. It sometimes nests among <span>Arctic terns</span>, which, like most white terns, are fiercely defensive of their nest and young and will attack large predators.</p>
<p>Like most other terns, the Aleutian tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, usually from saline environments. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.</p>
<p>This is a medium-sized tern, with a short, pointed bill and a long, deeply forked tail. It has a black cap with a white forehead, dark gray mantle and underparts and a mostly pale underwing with a dark secondary bar. It has a white rump and tail, black legs and a black bill.</p>
<p>The call is a musical <i>whee-hee-hee</i>.</p>
