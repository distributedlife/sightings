<p>The <b>Bar-throated Apalis</b> is a small <span>African</span> <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Apalis</span></i> of the family <span>Cisticolidae</span>.</p>
<p>It inhabits forest and scrub in <span>Southern</span> and <span>East Africa</span> from southern and eastern parts of <span>South Africa</span> north as far as the <span>Chyulu Hills</span> in <span>Kenya</span>. In the northern part of is range it is found only in highland areas where there are a number of <span>subspecies</span> restricted to isolated mountain ranges. Some of these may be treated as separate species including the <span>Namuli Apalis</span> (<i>A. lynesi</i>) in <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Yellow-throated Apalis</span> (<i>A. flavigularis</i>) of <span>Malawi</span> and <span>Taita Apalis</span> (<i>A. fascigularis</i>) in Kenya.</p>
<p>The Bar-throated Apalis is a slender bird with a long tail and is 11 to 13&#xA0;cm in length. The <span>plumage</span> varies depending on the subspecies: the upperparts can be grey or green while the underparts are white or pale yellow. All forms have a narrow black band across the breast, white outer tail-feathers and a pale eye. The black bill is fairly long and slender and is slightly curved. Females are similar to males but have a narrower breastband. <span>Juveniles</span> have buffer underparts and may have an incomplete breastband.</p>
<p>Pairs sing a duetting song with the female's call being higher-pitched than that of the male.</p>
<p>The oval, purse-shaped <span>nest</span> is made mainly of plant material. Three <span>eggs</span> are laid, these are bluish-white with reddish-brown spots. The <span>breeding season</span> lasts from August to January.</p>
<p>This species forages for <span>caterpillars</span> and other <span>insects</span> amongst vegetation, often forming <span>mixed-species flocks</span> with other birds.</p>
