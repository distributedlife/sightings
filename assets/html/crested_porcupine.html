<p><i>Hystrix cristata</i> is part of the family Hystricidae. The more common name for this species is the crested porcupine. The adult crested porcupine has an average head and body length of about 60 to 83&#xA0;cm (24 to 33&#xA0;in) long, discounting the tail, and weighs from 13 to 27&#xA0;kg (29 to 60&#xA0;lb).</p>
<p>Almost the entire body is covered with bristles which are either dark brown or black and rather coarse. This <span>mammal</span> is recognizable by the <span>quills</span> that run along the head, nape, and back that can be raised into a crest. Hence the name crested porcupine. There are also some sturdier quills which are about 35&#xA0;cm (14&#xA0;in) in length and run along the sides and back half of the body. These sturdier quills are used, for the most part, for defense and are usually marked with light and dark bands which alternate; these are not firmly attached. This porcupine has a shorter tail which has rattle quills at the end. The rattle quills broaden at the terminal end and the broad portion is hollow with thin walls. When these quills are vibrated they produce a hiss-like rattle.</p>
<p>The front feet of the crested porcupine have four developed and <span>clawed</span> digits with a regressed thumb, the rear feet have five. The paws have naked and padded soles and have a plantigrade gait. The ears are external and both the eyes and ears are very small with long <span>vibrissae</span> on its head. The skull is specific in many ways, first the <span>infraorbital foramen</span> is greatly enlarged so that portions of the <span>masseter</span> extend through it and attach from the frontal side surface of the snout. Second the angular process is inflected on the lower <span>jaw</span>, thirdly the nasal cavity is enlarged. Prominent pockets create enlarged areas of attachment for chewing <span>muscles</span>. <span>Collar bones</span> are very much reduced, and there are one <span>incisor</span>, one <span>premolar</span> and three <span>molars</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_and_digestion">Food and digestion</span></h2>
<p>The crested porcupine is for the most part <span>herbivorous</span>, eating roots, bulbs, crops. But occasionally they do consume insects, small vertebrates and carrion. In order to ingest <span>calcium</span> and sharpen incisors they often gnaw on bones. These animals often travel long distances looking for food. They have high crowned teeth that grind plant cells which are digested in the <span>stomach</span> and the undigested fibers are retained in an enlarged <span>appendix</span> and anterior large <span>intestine</span> where they are broken down by microorganisms.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>Most of what is known about reproduction in the crested porcupine comes from individuals in captivity. Usually female crested porcupines have one <span>litter</span> every year. One or two very well developed young are born in a chamber within the <span>burrow</span> that is usually lined with grass, but only after a 66 day <span>gestation</span> period, on average. The young weigh about 1000&#xA0;g at birth, which is about five percent of the mothers weight. They leave the den after one week. At this time the spines begin to harden. Crested porcupines reach adult weight at one to two years and are often <span>sexually mature</span> just before then.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The crested porcupine is a terrestrial mammal; they very seldom climb trees, but can swim. They are <span>nocturnal</span> and <span>monogamous</span>. The crested porcupine takes care of the young for a long time and small family groups consist of the adult pair and young of various ages. In defense, when disturbed, they raise and fan their quills to make themselves look bigger. If continually bothered, the crested porcupine will stamp its feet, whirr the quills, and charge the disturber back end first trying to stab the enemy with the thicker, shorter quills. These attacks are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas, and even humans.</p>
<p>Crested porcupines have been known to collect thousands of bones that they find at night. They are mostly nocturnal, and they may wander upon the <span>skeletons</span> of many animals. These include prehistoric animals, such as <i><span>Deinotherium</span></i>. They will collect these bones, and store them in an underground chamber, or cave. Sometimes humans dig up these bones, it is an amazing find for paleontologists and archaeologists.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population">Population</span></h2>
<p>There are eight species in the genus <i><span>Hystrix</span></i>, only two of which are found outside of <span>Asia</span>. The crested porcupine is widespread in <span>Africa</span> and <span>Italy</span>. Although it is favored in many parts of its range as food, its conservation status is set at least concern.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range">Range</span></h2>
<p>The crested porcupine is found in Italy, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. In the Mediterranean it is known from mainland Italy and the island of <span>Sicily</span>, <span>Morocco</span>, <span>Algeria</span>, <span>Tunisia</span>; there are also records from <span>Libya</span>, and along the <span>Egyptian</span> coast. It has been recorded from sea level to 2550&#xA0;m in Moroccan Anti Atlas. It is sometimes asserted that the porcupine was introduced to Italy by the Romans, but fossil and sub fossil remains suggest it was possibly present in Europe in the <span>Upper Pleistocene</span>.</p>
