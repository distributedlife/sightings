<p>The <b>Izu thrush</b> (<i>Turdus celaenops</i>), also known as the <b>Izu Islands thrush</b>, is a <span>thrush</span> native to the <span>Izu</span> and <span>Ryukyu Islands</span> of <span>Japan</span>, in particular, <span>Hachijojima</span>, <span>Mikurajima</span>, and <span>Miyakejima</span> in the former chain, and <span>Yakushima</span> and the <span>Tokara Islands</span> in the latter. This species is absent from the main islands of Japan, and due to its limited range, is listed in the <span>IUCN Red List</span> as Vulnerable.</p>
<p>Reaching a length of approximately 23&#xA0;cm, the Izu thrush has a distinctive dark plumage, with a black head and tail contrasting with yellow eye-ring and bill, chestnut brown wings, and a rust-red belly. This color pattern often elicits comparisons to the <span>American robin</span>.</p>
