<p>The <b>black and rufous elephant shrew</b> (<i>Rhynchocyon petersi</i>), also known as the <b>black and rufous sengi</b>, is one of 17 species of <span>elephant shrew</span> found only in <span>Africa</span>. Like other members of the genus <i><span>Rhynchocyon</span></i>, it is a relatively large species, with adults averaging about 28 cm (11 in) in length and 450-700 g (1.0-1.5 lb) in weight. It is native to <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. It eats insects (beetles, termites, ants) and spiders, supplementing this with fruits and seeds.</p>
<p>Because it is classified as <span>vulnerable</span>, several <span>zoos</span> have begun breeding this elephant shrew, including the <span>Philadelphia Zoo</span> in the United States. Two black and rufous elephant shrew males were born on February 4, 2007, at the <span>National Zoo</span> in <span>Washington, D.C.</span> They are now kept at the <span>Peabody Museum of Natural History</span> at <span>Yale University</span>.</p>
