<p>The <b>white-tailed crested flycatcher</b> (<i>Elminia albonotata</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the flycatcher family <span>Stenostiridae</span>. It has a discontinuous distribution in eastern <span>Africa</span>. There are three <span>subspecies</span>, <i>E. a. albonotata</i> of central <span>Kenya</span>, and <span>Uganda</span> through to south west <span>Tanzania</span>; <i>E. a. subvaerulea</i>, which ranges from southern Kenya to <span>Malawi</span> and <i>E. a. swynnertoni</i> of <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>Mozambique</span>.</p>
<p>The white-tailed crested flycatcher is a small (13&#xA0;cm) crested flycatcher with a long tail. The wings and <span>crest</span> of are black, the rest of the <span>plumage</span> is grey overall with a white belly, rump and the underside of the tail. The <span>bill</span> is black, the eye dark brown and the legs grey. The <span>call</span> of this species is weak and unstructured.</p>
<p>Its natural <span>habitat</span> is subtropical or tropical evergreen <span>montane forest</span> and surrounding <span>shrubland</span> and <span>bamboo</span>. It is found from 600 m to 1900 m in Tanzania's <span>Udzungwa Mountains</span>, and up to 2700 m elsewhere. Where its range overlaps with the closely related <span>white-bellied crested flycatcher</span> this species is found at higher altitudes and not below 2250 m, where its relative it is absent it ranges as low as 1200 m.</p>
<p>The diet of this species is not well studied, although like most flycatchers it feeds on invertebrates including <span>flies</span>, <span>ants</span>, <span>moths</span> and <span>spiders</span>. They travel in pairs or small family groups, sometimes joining <span>mixed-species feeding flocks</span>. During the breeding season pairs are territorial. They are <span>monogamous</span>, at the start of the season the male displays to the female using its tail and feeds the female. Two eggs are laid in a small nest in the fork of a branch, usually 2 m high in a tree, but up to 6 m. There is a division of labour between the pair, with the female undertaking all the <span>incubation</span> and the male feeding the chicks once they hatch. Chicks <span>fledge</span> after 15 days.</p>
