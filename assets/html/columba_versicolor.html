<p>The <b>Bonin wood pigeon</b> (<i>Columba versicolor</i>) was a <span>pigeon</span> <span>endemic</span> to <span>Nakodo-jima</span> and <span>Chichi-jima</span> in the <span>Ogasawara Islands</span> off the coast of <span>Japan</span>. It is known from four recorded specimens, the first from 1827 and the last from 1889. They averaged a length of 45&#xA0;cm. This pigeon died out late in the 19th century as a result of <span>deforestation</span>, hunting, and predation by introduced <span>rats</span> and <span>cats</span>.</p>

<p>The Bonin wood pigeon was a medium-sized <span>pigeon</span>, with an average length of 45&#xA0;cm. The upper parts of the pigeon's body were greyish-black with <span>iridescence</span> except on wing and tail. Crown has a green-purple iridescence, mantle to rump iridescent reflecting <span>violet</span>, <span>amethyst</span> and <span>turquoise</span>. Scapulars and remaining mantle glossed golden green with <span>bronze</span> reflections; wing coverts with dark turquoise green suffused with deep blue. The uppertail of the pigeon coverts broadly tipped with golden green. Breast to belly fringed with deep green and violet iridescence, being strongest on the breast. Iris blue or probably dark blue; <span>bill</span> greenish yellow having a pale tip; legs and the feet were dark red.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Last_confirmed_sighting">Last confirmed sighting</span></h2>
<p>The Bonin wood pigeon was confirmed extinct in Spring 1889 and the last sighting was in the forests of the Nakodo-Jima, <span>Japan</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>The Bonin wood pigeons usually <span>mated</span> in the trees or in the forests. Their eggs were particularly vulnerable to <span>crows</span> and other natural <span>predators</span>. They each normally make two <span>eggs</span> and the pigeons eggs usually takes 17 to 19 days to hatch into a young Bonin wood pigeon, just like any other wood pigeons of today.</p>
