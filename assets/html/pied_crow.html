<p>The <b>Pied Crow</b> (<i>Corvus albus</i>) is a widely distributed <span>African</span> bird species in the <span>crow</span> <span>genus</span>.</p>
<p>Structurally, the Pied Crow is better thought of as a small crow-sized Raven, especially as it can hybridise with the <span>Somali Crow</span> (Dwarf Raven) where their ranges meet in the <span>Horn of Africa</span>. Its behaviour, though, is more typical of the <span>Eurasian</span> <span>Carrion Crows</span>, and it may be a modern link (along with the Somali Crow) between the Eurasian crows and the <span>Common Raven</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is approximately the size of the European <span>Carrion Crow</span> or a little larger (46&#x2013;50&#xA0;cm in length) but has a proportionately larger bill, slightly longer tail and wings, and longer legs. As its name suggests, its glossy black head and neck are interrupted by a large area of white feathering from the shoulders down to the lower breast. The tail, bill and wings are black too. The eyes are dark brown. The white plumage of immature birds is often mixed with black. It resembles the <span>White-necked</span> and <span>Thick-billed Ravens</span> but has a much smaller bill.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Measurements">Measurements</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h3>
<p>In southern Africa the range overlaps with the <span>White-necked Raven</span>. The Pied Crow is slightly smaller and has a white chest and belly with a black, more delicate beak compared to the black chest and belly of the larger <span>White-necked Raven</span> which also has a white tipped and weightier beak. It is larger than the <span>Black Crow</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h3>
<p>The voice is described as a harsh <i>"ar-ar-ar-ar"</i> or <i>"karh-karh-karh"</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The Pied Crow was first described in 1776 by <span>Statius Muller</span>. Its specific name is the Latin adjective <i>albus</i>, meaning "white".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>This species, <span>Africa</span>'s most widespread member of the genus <i>Corvus</i>, occurs from <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>, specifically <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Somalia</span> and <span>Eritrea</span> down to the <span>Cape of Good Hope</span> and on the large island of <span>Madagascar</span>, the <span>Comoros</span> islands, <span>Aldabra</span> group islands, <span>Zanzibar</span>, <span>Pemba</span> and <span>Fernando Po</span>. It inhabits mainly open country with villages and towns nearby. It does not occur in the equatorial <span>rainforest</span> region. It is rarely seen very far from <span>human</span> habitation, though it is not as tied to the urban way of life as the <span>House Crow</span> (<i>Corvus splendens</i>) of <span>Asia</span>, and may be encountered far from human habitation in Eritrea.</p>

<p>Pied Crows are generally encountered in pairs or small groups, although an abundant source of food may bring large numbers of birds. The species behaves in a similar manner to the Hooded and Carrion Crows. In <span>Dakar</span>, birds have been observed mobbing passing Ospreys and Snake Eagles but avoiding <span>Black Kites</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>All of its food is obtained from the ground such as insects and other small <span>invertebrates</span>, small <span>reptiles</span>, small <span>mammals</span>, young <span>birds</span> and <span>eggs</span>, grain, <span>peanuts</span>, <span>carrion</span> and any scraps of human food and fruit. It has been recorded killing and eating roosting <span>Fruit Bats</span> and is frequently seen (sometimes in huge numbers) scavenging around slaughterhouses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>The nest is usually built in tall, isolated trees, though sometimes smaller specimens are used, depending on availability. The cross supports of <span>telephone</span> poles are also frequently used, and both sexes build the nest. A clutch of 3&#x2013;6 eggs is laid from September to November (depending on latitude) and are pale green spotted with various shades of brown. The eggs are normally covered when the incubating female leaves the nest. Incubation is 18&#x2013;19 days and the young are usually <span>fledged</span> by around 45 days. Both sexes rear the young.</p>
