<p>The <b>superb starling</b> (<i>Lamprotornis superbus</i>) is a member of the <span>starling</span> family of <span>birds</span>. It can commonly be found in <span>East Africa</span>, including <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, and <span>Tanzania</span>. It was formerly known as <i>Spreo superbus</i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This species is 18 to 19&#xA0;cm (7.1 to 7.5&#xA0;in) long. Adults have black heads and iridescent blue-to-green back, upper breast, wings, and tail. The belly is red-orange, separated from the blue breast by a white bar. The undertail coverts and the wing linings are white. Juveniles have duller plumage with no more than a suggestion of the white breast band. Their irises are brown, later grayish white, eventually the adult's purple.</p>
<p>The superb starling has a long and loud song consisting of trills and chatters. At midday it gives a softer song of repeated phrases. There are several harsh calls, the most complex of which is described as "a shrill, screeching <i>skerrrreeee-cherrrroo-tcherreeeeeet</i>."</p>
<p>This species feeds primarily on the ground, often below, or in the vicinity of, acacia trees. It is <span>gregarious</span> and is generally rather tame and unafraid of people.</p>
<p>The appearance of the superb starling is very similar to <span>Hildebrandt's starling</span>, also found in East Africa. The superb starling is distinguished by having white eyes, as opposed to the red eyes in the Hildebrandt's.</p>
