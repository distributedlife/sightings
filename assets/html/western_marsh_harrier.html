<p>The <b>western marsh harrier</b> (<i>Circus aeruginosus</i>) is a large <span>harrier</span>, a <span>bird of prey</span> from <span>temperate</span> and <span>subtropical</span> western <span>Eurasia</span> and adjacent <span>Africa</span>. It is also known as the <b>Eurasian marsh harrier</b>.</p>
<p>Formerly, a number of relatives were included in <i>C. aeruginosus</i>, which was then known as <b>"<span>marsh harrier</span>"</b>. The related <span>taxa</span> are now generally considered to be separate species: the <span>eastern marsh harrier</span> (<i>C. spilonotus</i>) and the possibly distinct <span>Papuan harrier</span> (<i>C. (s.) spilothorax</i>) of eastern Asia and the <span>Wallacea</span>, the <span>swamp harrier</span> (<i>C. approximans</i>) of <span>Australasia</span> and the <span>Madagascar marsh harrier</span> (<i>C. maillardi</i>) of the western <span>Indian Ocean</span> islands.</p>
<p>The western marsh harrier is often divided into two <span>subspecies</span>, the widely <span>migratory</span> <i>C. a. aeruginosus</i> which is found across most of its range, and <i>C. a. harterti</i> which is resident all-year in north-west Africa.</p>

A fairly pale adult female (note brown <span>remiges</span> and yellow eye) winters near <span>Hodal</span> (<span>Faridabad district</span>, <span>Haryana</span>, <span>India</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The western marsh harrier is 43 to 54&#xA0;cm in length, and has a wingspan of 115 to 130&#xA0;cm and a weight of 400 to 650&#xA0;g in males and 500 to 800&#xA0;g in females. It is a large, bulky <span>harrier</span> with fairly broad wings, and has a strong and peculiar <span>sexual dichromatism</span>. The male's <span>plumage</span> is mostly a <span>cryptic</span> reddish-brown with lighter yellowish streaks, which are particularly prominent on the breast. The head and shoulders are mostly pale greyish-yellowish. The <span>rectrices</span> and the secondary and tertiary <span>remiges</span> are pure grey, the latter contrasting with the brown forewing and the black primary remiges at the wingtips. The upperside and underside of the wing look similar, though the brown is lighter on the underwing. Whether from the side or below, flying males appear characteristically three-colored brown-grey-black. The legs, feet, <span>irides</span> and the <span>cere</span> of the black bill are yellow.</p>
<p>The female is almost entirely chocolate-brown. The top of the head, the throat and the shoulders have of a conspicuously lighter yellowish colour; this can be clearly delimited and very contrasting, or (particularly in worn plumage) be more washed-out, resembling the male's head colours. But the eye area of the female is always darker, making the light eye stand out, while the male's head is altogether not very contrastingly coloured and the female lacks the grey wing-patch and tail. Juveniles are similar to females, but usually have less yellow, particularly on the shoulders.</p>
<p>There is a rare <span>hypermelanic</span> <span>morph</span> with largely dark plumage. It is most often found in the east of the species' range. Juveniles of this morph may look entirely black in flight.</p>

The male is characterised by the very clear chestnut brown mantle and the grey secondaries and black outer primaries</div>
</div>

<p>This species has a wide breeding range from Europe and northwestern Africa to Central Asia and the northern parts of the Middle East. It breeds in almost every country of Europe but is absent from mountainous regions and <span>subarctic</span> <span>Scandinavia</span>. It is rare but increasing in <span>Great Britain</span> where it has spread as far as eastern Scotland. In the Middle East there are populations in <span>Turkey</span>, <span>Iraq</span>, and <span>Iran</span>, while in Central Asia the range extends eastwards as far as north-west <span>China</span>, <span>Mongolia</span>, and the <span>Lake Baikal</span> region of <span>Siberia</span>.</p>
<p>Most populations of the western marsh harrier are migratory or dispersive. Some birds winter in milder regions of southern and western Europe, while others migrate to the <span>Sahel</span>, <span>Nile</span> basin and <span>Great Lakes</span> region in <span>Africa</span>, or to <span>Arabia</span>, the <span>Indian subcontinent</span>, and <span>Myanmar</span>. The all-year resident <span>subspecies</span> <i>harterti</i> inhabits <span>Morocco</span>, <span>Algeria</span>, and <span>Tunisia</span>.</p>
<p><span>Vagrants</span> have reached <span>Iceland</span>, the <span>Azores</span>, <span>Malaysia</span>, and <span>Sumatra</span>. The first documented (but unconfirmed) record for the Americas was one bird reportedly photographed on 4 December 1994 at <span>Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge</span> in <span>Accomack County, Virginia</span>. Subsequently, there were confirmed records from <span>Guadeloupe</span> (winter of 2002/2003) and from <span>Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife Refuge</span> in <span>Puerto Rico</span> (early 2004 and January/February 2006).</p>

The female usually is identifiable by the rather dark plumage except the creamy crown, nape, and throat</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like the other marsh harriers, it is strongly associated with <span>wetland</span> areas, especially those rich in <span>common reed</span> (<i>Phragmites australis</i>). It can also be met with in a variety of other open habitats, such as <span>farmland</span> and <span>grassland</span>, particularly where these border marshland. It is a <span>territorial</span> bird in the breeding season, and even in winter it seems less social than other harriers, which often gather in large flocks. But this is probably simply due to <span>habitat</span> preferences, as the marsh harriers are completely <span>allopatric</span> while several of <i>C. aeruginosus</i> grassland and <span>steppe</span> relatives winter in the same regions and assemble at food sources such as <span>locust</span> outbreaks. Still, in <span>Keoladeo National Park</span> of <span>Rajasthan</span> (<span>India</span>) around 100 Eurasian marsh harriers are observed to roost together each November/December; they assemble in tall grassland dominated by <i><span>Desmostachya bipinnata</span></i> and <span>vetiver</span> (<i>Chrysopogon zizanioides</i>), but where this is too disturbed by human activity they will use floating carpets of <span>common water hyacinth</span> (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) instead &#x2013; the choice of such roost sites may be to give early warning of predators, which will conspicuously rustle through the plants if they try to sneak upon the resting birds</p>
<p>It hunts in typical <span>harrier</span> fashion, gliding low over flat open ground on its search for prey, with its wings held in a shallow V-shape and often with dangling legs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>It feeds on small mammals, small birds, insects, reptiles, and frogs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>The start of the breeding season varies from mid-March to early May. Western marsh harrier males often pair with two and occasionally three females. <span>Pair bonds</span> usually last for a single breeding season, but some pairs remain together for several years.</p>
<p>The ground nest is made of sticks, <span>reeds</span> and grasses. It is usually built in a <span>reedbed</span>, but the species will also nest in <span>arable</span> fields. There are between three and eight eggs in a normal <span>clutch</span>. The eggs are oval in shape and white in colour, with a bluish or greenish tinge when recently laid. The eggs are incubated for 31&#x2013;38 days and the young birds <span>fledge</span> after 35&#x2013;40 days.</p>

Western marsh harrier in <span>Estonia</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The western marsh harrier declined in many areas between the 19th and the late 20th centuries due to persecution, <span>habitat destruction</span> and excessive <span>pesticide</span> use. It is a now a protected species in many countries. Its numbers are rising again in many places, most notably perhaps in <span>Great Britain</span>, where a single breeding female was left in 1971, whereas today over 200 pairs are present.</p>
<p>It still faces a number of threats, including the shooting of birds migrating through the <span>Mediterranean</span> region. They are vulnerable to disturbance during the breeding season and also liable to <span>lead shot</span> poisoning. Still, the threats to this bird have been largely averted and it is today classified as Species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
