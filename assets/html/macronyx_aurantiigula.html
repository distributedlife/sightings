<p>The <b>Pangani Longclaw</b> (<i>Macronyx aurantiigula</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Motacillidae</span> family, which includes the pipits and wagtails. It is found in <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Somalia</span>. The bird's natural <span>habitats</span> are dry <span>savanna</span> and subtropical or tropical dry lowland <span>grassland</span>.</p>
<p>Originally described by German ornithologist <span>Anton Reichenow</span> in 1891, the Pangani Longclaw is a member of the longclaw genus <i><span>Macronyx</span></i>. The genus name is derived from the <span>Ancient Greek</span> words &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3CC;&#x3C2;/<i>makros</i> "long", and &#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C5;&#x3BE;/<i>onyx</i> "claw" or "talons". The species name is derived from the <span>Latin</span> words <i>aurantium</i> "orange", and <i>g&#x16D;la</i> "throat" or "gullet"</p>
<p>The Pangani Longclaw measures around 20&#xA0;cm (8&#xA0;in) in length. As its species name suggests, it has an yellow-orange throat. This is bordered with a black necklace. The upperparts are mottled various shades of brown, and the belly is yellow. In immature birds, the belly is more buff than yellow and the dark breast band less distinct. The flanks are streaked black and buff. The flight is jerky. The call has been described as a high-pitched <i>siuuweeeee</i>, with a pitch that rises, falls then rises before fading away.</p>
<p>Its more orange throat helps distinguish it from the <span>Yellow-throated Longclaw</span> and <span>Abyssinian Longclaw</span>, however the throats of female and older immature Pangani Longclaws can be more yellow. The last species is also found further north in the Horn of Africa in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>A predominantly ground-dwelling bird, the Pangani Longclaw inhabits grasslands, to an altitude of 1800&#xA0;m (5500&#xA0;ft).</p>
