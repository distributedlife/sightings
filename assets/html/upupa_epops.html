It is the only <span>extant</span> species in the <span>family</span> <b>Upupidae</b>. One insular species, the <span>Saint Helena hoopoe</span>, is extinct, and the <span>Madagascar subspecies</span> of the hoopoe is sometimes elevated to a full species. Like the Latin name <i>upupa</i>, the English name is an <span>onomatopoeic</span> form which imitates the cry of the bird.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>The hoopoe is classified in the <span>clade</span> <span>Coraciiformes</span>, which also includes <span>kingfishers</span>, <span>bee-eaters</span>, <span>rollers</span>, and <span>woodhoopoes</span>. A close relationship between the hoopoe and the woodhoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their <span>stapes</span>. In the <span>Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy</span>, the Hoopoe is separated from the <span>Coraciiformes</span> as a separate order, the <span>Upupiformes</span>. Some authorities place the woodhoopoes in the Upupiformes as well.</p>
<p>The <span>fossil</span> record of the hoopoes is very incomplete, with the earliest fossil coming from the <span>Quaternary</span>. The fossil record of their relatives is older, with fossil <span>woodhoopoes</span> dating back to the <span>Miocene</span> and those of an extinct related family, the <span>Messelirrisoridae</span>, dating from the <span>Eocene</span>.</p>
<p>It is the only extant member of its family, although some treatments consider some of the subspecies as separate species. Several authors have separated the Madagascan subspecies (<i>U. e. marginata</i>) as a separate species, and also the resident African form <i>U. e. africana</i>. The morphological differences between the most commonly split subspecies, <i>U. e. marginata</i>, and the other subspecies are minor, and only <i>U. e. marginata</i> has distinctly different <span>vocalisations</span>. One accepted separate species, the <span>Saint Helena hoopoe</span>, <i>U. antaios</i>, lived on the island of <span>St Helena</span> but became extinct in the 16th century, presumably due to introduced species.</p>
<p>The genus <i>Upupa</i> was created by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758. It then included three other species with long curved bills:</p>

The muscles of the head allow the Hoopoe's bill to be opened when it is inserted into the ground</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hoopoe is a medium sized bird, 25&#x2013;32&#xA0;cm (9.8&#x2013;12.6&#xA0;in) long, with a 44&#x2013;48&#xA0;cm (17&#x2013;19&#xA0;in) wingspan. It weighs 46&#x2013;89&#xA0;g (1.6&#x2013;3.1&#xA0;oz). The species is highly distinctive, with a long, thin tapering <span>bill</span> that is black with a fawn base. The strengthened <span>musculature</span> of the head allows the bill to be opened when probing inside the soil. The hoopoe has broad and rounded wings capable of strong flight; these are larger in the northern <span>migratory</span> subspecies. The hoopoe has a characteristic undulating <span>flight</span>, which is like that of a giant <span>butterfly</span>, caused by the wings half closing at the end of each beat or short sequence of beats.</p>
<p>The call is typically a trisyllabic <i>oop-oop-oop</i>, which gives rise to its English and scientific names, although two and four syllables are also common. In the Himalayas, the calls can be confused with that of the <span>Himalayan cuckoo</span> (<i>Cuculus saturatus</i>), although the cuckoo typically produces four notes. Other calls include rasping croaks, when alarmed, and hisses. Females produce a wheezy note during <span>courtship feeding</span> by the male. Both genders, when disturbed, call a rough <i>charrrrrr,</i> strongly reminiscent of the warning cry of the <span>Eurasian jay</span>. The food begging call of the nestlings is similar to that of a <span>common swift</span>: <i>tiiii</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The hoopoe is widespread in <span>Europe</span>, <span>Asia</span>, and North <span>Africa</span>, Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Most European and north Asian birds <span>migrate</span> to the tropics in winter. In contrast, the African populations are sedentary all year. The species has been a <span>vagrant</span> in <span>Alaska</span>; <i>U. e. saturata</i> was recorded there in 1975 in the <span>Yukon Delta</span>. Hoopoes have been known to breed north of their European range, and in southern England during warm, dry summers that provide plenty of grasshoppers and similar insects, although as of the early 1980s northern European populations were reported to be in the decline, possibly due to changes in climate.</p>
<p>The hoopoe has two basic requirements of its habitat: bare or lightly vegetated ground on which to forage and vertical surfaces with cavities (such as trees, cliffs or even walls, nestboxes, haystacks, and abandoned burrows) in which to nest. These requirements can be provided in a wide range of ecosystems, and as a consequence the hoopoe inhabits a wide range of habitats such as heathland, wooded steppes, savannas and grasslands, as well as forest glades. The Madagascar subspecies also makes use of more dense primary forest. The modification of natural habitats by humans for various agricultural purposes has led to hoopoes becoming common in olive groves, orchards, vineyards, parkland and farmland, although they are less common and are declining in intensively farmed areas. Hunting is of concern in southern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Hoopoes make seasonal movements in response to rain in some regions such as in Ceylon and in the Western Ghats. Birds have been seen at high altitudes during migration across the <span>Himalayas</span>. One was recorded at about 6,400&#xA0;m (21,000&#xA0;ft) by the first Mount Everest expedition.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In what was long thought to be a defensive posture, hoopoes sunbathe by spreading out their wings and tail low against the ground and tilting their head up; they often fold their wings and preen halfway through. They also enjoy taking dust and sand baths.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet_and_feeding">Diet and feeding</span></h3>
<p>The diet of the hoopoe is mostly composed of <span>insects</span>, although small <span>reptiles</span>, <span>frogs</span> and plant matter such as seeds and berries are sometimes taken as well. It is a solitary forager which typically feeds on the ground. More rarely they will feed in the air, where their strong and rounded wings make them fast and manoeuvrable, in pursuit of numerous swarming insects. More commonly their foraging style is to stride over relatively open ground and periodically pause to probe the ground with the full length of their bill. Insect larvae, pupae and <span>mole crickets</span> are detected by the bill and either extracted or dug out with the strong feet. Hoopoes will also feed on insects on the surface, probe into piles of leaves, and even use the bill to lever large stones and flake off bark. Common diet items include <span>crickets</span>, <span>locusts</span>, <span>beetles</span>, <span>earwigs</span>, <span>cicadas</span>, <span>ant lions</span>, <span>bugs</span> and <span>ants</span>. These can range from 10 to 150&#xA0;mm in length, with a preferred prey size of around 20&#x2013;30&#xA0;mm. Larger prey items are beaten against the ground or a preferred stone to kill them and remove indigestible body parts such as wings and legs.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Hoopoes are <span>monogamous</span>, although the pair bond apparently only lasts for a single season, and <span>territorial</span>. The male calls frequently to advertise his ownership of the territory. Chases and fights between rival males (and sometimes females) are common and can be brutal. Birds will try to stab rivals with their bills, and individuals are occasionally blinded in fights. The nest is in a hole in a tree or wall, and has a narrow entrance. It may be unlined, or various scraps may be collected. The female alone is responsible for <span>incubating</span> the eggs. <span>Clutch size</span> varies with location: northern hemisphere birds lay more eggs than those in the southern hemisphere, and birds at higher latitudes have larger clutches than those closer to the equator. In central and northern Europe and Asia the clutch size is around 12, whereas it is around four in the tropics and seven in the subtropics. The eggs are round and milky blue when laid, but quickly discolour in the increasingly dirty nest. They weigh 4.5&#xA0;grams. A replacement clutch is possible.</p>
<p>Hoopoes have well-developed anti-predator defences in the nest. The <span>uropygial gland</span> of the incubating and brooding female is quickly modified to produce a foul-smelling liquid, and the glands of nestlings do so as well. These secretions are rubbed into the plumage. The secretion, which smells like rotting meat, is thought to help deter predators, as well as deter <span>parasites</span> and possibly act as an antibacterial agent. The secretions stop soon before the young leave the nest. From the age of six days, nestlings can also direct streams of faeces at intruders, and will hiss at them in a snake-like fashion. The young also strike with their bill or with one wing.</p>
<p>The incubation period for the species is between 15 and 18 days, during which time the male feeds the female. Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the chicks are born asynchronously. The chicks hatch with a covering of <span>downy feathers</span>. By around day three to five, feather quills emerge which will become the adult feathers. The chicks are brooded by the female for between 9 to 14 days. The female later joins the male in the task of bringing food. The young <span>fledge</span> in 26 to 29 days and remain with the parents for about a week more.</p>

Hoopoe (&#x5D3;&#x5D5;&#x5DB;&#x5D9;&#x5E4;&#x5EA;) in <span>Israel</span>. The Hoopoe is Israel's <span>national bird</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The diet of the hoopoe includes many species considered by humans to be <span>pests</span>, such as the pupae of the <span>processionary moth</span>, a damaging forest pest. For this reason the species is afforded protection under the law in many countries.</p>
<p>Hoopoes are distinctive birds and have made a cultural impact over much of their range. They were considered sacred in <span>Ancient Egypt</span>, and were "depicted on the walls of tombs and temples". They achieved a similar standing in <span>Minoan Crete</span>.</p>
<p>In the Bible, <span>Leviticus</span> 11:13&#x2013;19, hoopoes were listed among the animals that are detestable and should not be eaten. They are also listed in <span>Deuteronomy</span> (14:18) as not <span>kosher</span>.</p>
<p>Hoopoes also appear in the <span>Quran</span>, in Surah Al-Naml 27:20&#x2013;22: "And he <span>Solomon</span> sought among the birds and said: How is it that I see not the hoopoe, or is he among the absent? (20) I verily will punish him with hard punishment or I verily will slay him, or he verily shall bring me a plain excuse. (21) But he [the hoopoe] was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not, and I come unto thee from <span>Sheba</span> with sure tidings." Islamic literature also states that a hoopoe saved <span>Moses</span> and the children of Israel from being crushed by the giant Og after crossing the <span>Red Sea</span>.</p>
<p>Hoopoes were seen as a symbol of virtue in <span>Persia</span>. A hoopoe was the leader of the birds in the Persian book of poems <i><span>The Conference of the Birds</span></i>.</p>
<p>Hoopoes were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in <span>Scandinavia</span>. In <span>Estonian</span> tradition, hoopoes are strongly connected with death and the <span>underworld</span>; their song is believed to foreshadow death for many people or cattle.</p>
<p>The hoopoe is the king of the birds in the <span>Ancient Greek</span> comedy <i><span>The Birds</span></i> by <span>Aristophanes</span>. In <span>Ovid</span>'s <i><span>Metamorphoses</span></i>, book 6, King <span>Tereus</span> of <span>Thrace</span> rapes <span>Philomela</span>, his wife <span>Procne</span>'s sister, and cuts out her tongue. In revenge, Procne kills their son Itys and serves him as a stew to his father. When Tereus sees the boy's head, which is served on a platter, he grabs a sword but just as he attempts to kill the sisters, they are turned into birds&#x2014;Procne into a <span>swallow</span> and Philomela into a <span>nightingale</span>. Tereus himself is turned into an <i>epops</i> (6.674), translated as <i><span>lapwing</span></i> by Dryden and <i>lappewincke</i> (<i>lappewinge</i>) by <span>John Gower</span> in his <i><span>Confessio Amantis</span></i>, or <i>hoopoe</i> in A.S. Kline's translation. The bird's crest indicates his royal status, and his long, sharp beak is a symbol of his violent nature. English translators and poets probably had the <span>northern lapwing</span> in mind, considering its crest.</p>
<p>The hoopoe was chosen as the <span>national bird</span> of <span>Israel</span> in May 2008 in conjunction with the country's 60th anniversary, following a national survey of 155,000 citizens, outpolling the <span>white-spectacled bulbul</span>. It is the state bird of the <span>Punjab</span> province of <span>India</span>. The hoopoe appears on the Logo of the <span>University of Johannesburg</span> and is the official mascot of the University's sports. The municipality of <span>Armstedt</span>, Germany, has a hoopoe in its coat of arms.</p>
