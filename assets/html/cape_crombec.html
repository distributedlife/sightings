<p>The <b>Long-billed Crombec</b> or <b>Cape Crombec</b> (<i>Sylvietta rufescens</i>) is an <span>African warbler</span>.</p>
<p>The Long-billed Crombec breeds in southern <span>Africa</span> from the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Zambia</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> southwards to <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>This is a common species in <span>fynbos</span>, open woodland, <span>savannah</span> and dry <i><span>Acacia</span></i> scrub.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Long-billed Crombec is a small, nearly tailless bird 12&#xA0;cm long and weighing around 16 g. Its upperparts are brownish grey-brown, and there is a pale grey <span>supercilium</span>, separated from the whitish throat by a dark eye stripe. The whitish breast shades into the buff belly. The long slightly curved bill is blackish.</p>
<p>The sexes are similar, and the juvenile resembles the adult. The call is a variable series of trilled notes including <i>trreee-rriiit trreee-rriiit</i> and a harsh <i>pttt</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Long-billed Crombec's nest is a large, hanging bag of grasses, spider webs, and plant fibres, which is attached to the lower limbs of a tree, often an <i>Acacia</i>. The one to three white eggs are incubated for two weeks to hatching, and the chicks are fed by both parents for another two weeks to fledging. This territorial species is monogamous, pairing for life.</p>
<p>This bird is usually seen alone, in pairs, or in family groups as it forages methodically from the bottom to the top of bushes and trees for <span>insects</span> and grass seeds. It will join <span>mixed-species feeding flocks</span>.</p>
<p>It moves between trees with a bouncy flight.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 4,500,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;. The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>
