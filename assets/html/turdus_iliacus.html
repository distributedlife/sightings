<p>The <b>redwing</b> (<i>Turdus iliacus</i>) is a <span>bird</span> in the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae, native to <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>, slightly smaller than the related <span>song thrush</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 under its current scientific name.</p>
<p>The English name derives from the bird's red underwing. It is not closely related to the <span>red-winged blackbird</span>, a <span>North American</span> species sometimes <span>nicknamed</span> "redwing", which is an <span>icterid</span>, not a thrush. The binomial name derives from the <span>Latin</span> words <i>turdus</i>, "thrush", and <i>ile</i> "flank".</p>
<p>The redwing has two <span>subspecies</span>:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is 20&#x2013;24&#xA0;cm long with a wingspan of 33&#x2013;34.5&#xA0;cm and a weight of 50&#x2013;75&#xA0;g. The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and with dark brown spots on the white underparts. The most striking identification features are the red flanks and underwing, and the creamy white stripe above the eye.</p>
<p>The male has a varied short song, and a whistling flight call.</p>

<p>It breeds in northern regions of Europe and Asia, from <span>Iceland</span> south to northernmost <span>Scotland</span>, and east through <span>Scandinavia</span>, the <span>Baltic States</span>, northern <span>Poland</span> and <span>Belarus</span>, and through most of <span>Russia</span> to about <span>165&#xB0;E</span> in <span>Chukotka Autonomous Okrug</span>. In recent years it has expanded its range slightly, both in eastern Europe where it now breeds south into northern <span>Ukraine</span>, and in southern <span>Greenland</span>, where the <span>Qaqortoq</span> area was colonised in 1990&#x2013;1991.</p>
<p>It is often replaced by the related <span>ring ouzel</span> in areas of higher altitude.</p>
<p>It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in western, central and southern Europe, north-west <span>Africa</span>, and south-west Asia east to northern <span>Iran</span>. Birds in some parts of the west of the breeding range (particularly south-western <span>Norway</span>) may be resident, not migrating at all, while those in the far east of the range migrate at least 6,500&#x2013;7,000&#xA0;km to reach their wintering grounds.</p>
<p>There are multiple records of vagrants from the north-east coast of <span>North America</span>, as well as two sightings on the north-west coast (one in Washington in 2005, and one in Seward, Alaska in November 2011).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour_and_ecology">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>
<p>Migrating and wintering birds often form loose flocks of 10 to 200 or more birds, often feeding together with <span>fieldfares</span>, <span>common blackbirds</span>, and <span>starlings</span>, sometimes also with <span>mistle thrushes</span>, <span>song thrushes</span>, and <span>ring ouzels</span>. Unlike the song thrush, the more nomadic redwing does not tend to return regularly to the same wintering areas.</p>

Nests are often constructed on the ground.</div>

</div>
<p>It breeds in <span>conifer</span> and <span>birch</span> forest and <span>tundra</span>. Redwings nest in shrubs or on the ground, laying four to six <span>eggs</span> in a neat nest. The eggs are typically 2.6&#xA0;x&#xA0;1.9 centimetres in size and weigh 4.6&#xA0;grammes, of which 5% is shell, and which hatch after 12&#x2013;13 days. The chicks fledge at 12&#x2013;15 days, but the young remain dependent on their parents for a further 14 days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of <span>insects</span> and <span>earthworms</span> all year, supplemented by <span>berries</span> in autumn and winter, particularly of <span>rowan</span> <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> and <span>hawthorn</span> <i>Crataegus monogyna</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_threats">Natural threats</span></h3>
<p>A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried <span>haematozoans</span>, particularly <i><span>Haemoproteus</span></i> and <i><span>Trypanosoma</span></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>The redwing has an extensive range, estimated at 10&#xA0;million&#xA0;square kilometres (3.8&#xA0;million square miles), and a large population, including an estimated 31 to 42 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <span>IUCN Red List</span> (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as being of <span>least concern</span>. Numbers can be adversely affected by severe winters, which may cause heavy mortality, and cold wet summers, which reduce breeding success.</p>
