<p>The <b>ribbon seal</b> (<i>Histriophoca fasciata</i>) is a medium-sized <span>pinniped</span> from the <span>true seal</span> family (Phocidae). A seasonally ice-bound species, it is found in the <span>Arctic</span> and <span>Subarctic</span> regions of the <span>North Pacific Ocean</span>, notably in the <span>Bering Sea</span> and <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span>. It is distinguished by its striking coloration, with two wide white strips and two circles against dark brown or black fur.</p>
<p>It is the only living species in the genus <i><b>Histriophoca</b></i>, although a possible fossil species, '<i>Histriophoca' alekseevi</i>, has been described from the Miocene of <span>Moldova</span>.</p>

<p>Adult seals are recognizable by their black skin, which carries four white markings: a strip around the neck, one around the tail and a circular marking on each body side, which encloses the front fins. The contrast is particularly strong with the males, while with females the difference in color between bright and dark portions is often less conspicuous. Newborn ribbon seal pups have white natal fur. After <span>moulting</span> their natal fur, their color changes to blue-grey on their backs and silvery beneath; after some years some portions become darker and others brighter, and only at the age of four years does the typical design show.</p>
<p>The ribbon seal has a large <span>inflatable</span> <span>air sac</span> that is connected to the <span>trachea</span> and extends on the right side over the ribs. It is larger in males than in females, and it is thought that it is used to produce <span>underwater</span> <span>vocalizations</span>, perhaps for attracting a <span>mate</span>. The ribbon seal can grow about 1.6&#xA0;m (5.2&#xA0;ft) long, weighing 95&#xA0;kg (209&#xA0;lb) in both sexes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The ribbon seal lives in the Arctic parts of the <span>Pacific Ocean</span>. During winter and spring, it <span>hauls out</span> on <span>pack ice</span> to <span>breed</span>, <span>molt</span>, and give birth. During this time, it is found at the <span>ice front</span> in the <span>Bering</span> and <span>Okhotsk</span> Seas. During the summer and autumn, the ribbon seal lives in open water, though some move north as the <span>ice</span> recedes with warmer temperatures. Little is known about its habit during this time, as it is so far from land and human observation. The ribbon seal almost never comes to land.</p>
<p>Thus far, there have been only two acknowledged instances where ribbon seals have been found as far south as Seattle, Washington and even further south at Morro Bay, California. There was nothing to suggest that illness was the cause of either seals appearance at either place, as both appeared to be healthy.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The diet of ribbon seal consists almost exclusively of <span>pelagic</span> creatures: fish like <span>pollocks</span>, <span>eelpouts</span>, the <span>Arctic Cod</span> and <span>cephalopods</span> such as <span>squid</span> and <span>octopus</span>; young seals eat <span>crustaceans</span> as well. The ribbon seal dives to depths of up to 200 m in search of food; it is <span>solitary</span> and forms no herds. Females reach <span>sexual maturity</span> at 2 to 5 years and males reach <span>sexual maturity</span> at 3 to 6 years, and an individual may reach twenty to twenty-five years of age. Mating takes place from late April to early May. Young animals are born on the ice in April and May. They are fed for four weeks on their mother's milk, then leave their mother. They remain on the ice for a few more weeks, in which they lose their dense white fur and lose a drastic amount of weight. After this period, they are able to dive and hunt by themselves.</p>
<p><span>Predators</span> of the ribbon seal include the <span>orca</span>, the <span>Pacific sleeper shark</span>, the <span>polar bear</span> and the <span>Arctic sleeper shark</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Protection">Protection</span></h2>
<p>Young ribbon seals look like young <span>harp seals</span>, and like these, they were hunted for their fur. Since they do not form herds, ribbon seals were more difficult to catch than harp seals. Since the <span>Soviet Union</span> limited the hunt on ribbon seals in 1969, their population has recovered. The current population is around 250,000.</p>

<p>In March 2008 the US government agreed to study Alaska's ribbon seal population and considered adding it to the endangered species list. However, in December 2008, the US government decided that sea ice critical to the seals' survival will not be endangered by <span>global warming</span>, and declined to list the species. Instead, it became a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service <span>Species of Concern</span>. The US Government&#x2019;s <span>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>, <span>National Marine Fisheries Service</span> (NMFS), has some concerns regarding status and threats of some species, for which insufficient information is available to list them under the US <span>Endangered Species Act</span>.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2009 the <span>Center for Biological Diversity</span> <span>filed suit to get the decision changed</span>.</p>
