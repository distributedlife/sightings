<p>The <b>melon-headed whale</b> (<span>species</span> <i>Peponocephala electra</i>; other names are <b>many-toothed blackfish</b> and <b>electra dolphin</b>) is a <span>cetacean</span> of the <span>oceanic dolphin</span> <span>family</span> (<span>Delphinidae</span>). It is closely related to the <span>pygmy killer whale</span> and <span>pilot whale</span>, and collectively these <span>dolphin</span> species are known by the common name <span>blackfish</span>. It is also related to the <span>false killer whale</span>. The melon-headed whale is widespread throughout the world's <span>tropical</span> waters, although not often seen by humans because it prefers <span>deep water</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The melon-headed whale has a body shape rather like a <span>torpedo</span>. Its head is a rounded cone giving the animal its common name. The body is more or less uniformly light grey except for a dark grey face &#x2013; sometimes called the "mask". The flippers are long and pointed. The <span>dorsal fin</span> is tall with a pointed tip &#x2013; reminiscent of its cousin the <span>orca</span>. When viewed in profile its head is not as rounded as the <span>Pygmy killer whale</span> and this may aid identification.</p>
<p>This whale is capable of very fast swimming, particularly when startled. In flight, it often makes short low jumps clear of the sea surface, splashing lots of water. Melon-headed whales usually gather in large numbers (at least 100 and possibly as many as 1,000 on rare occasions) and sometimes strand together.</p>
<p>The Melon-headed whale weighs 10&#x2013;15 kilograms (22&#x2013;33&#xA0;lb) at birth and is 1 metre (3.3&#xA0;ft) long. An adult grows up to 3 metres (9.8&#xA0;ft) long and weighs over 200 kilograms (440&#xA0;lb). The whales' lifespan is at least 20 years and probably more than 30 years for females.</p>
<p>Their primary diet is <span>squid</span>.</p>
<p>Hawaiian melon-headed whales spend much of their daytime at the surface resting.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_and_distribution">Population and distribution</span></h2>
<p>The melon-headed whale lives far from shore in all the world's <span>tropical</span> and sub-tropical oceans. At the northern fringes of its range it may also be found in <span>temperate</span> waters. Individuals have been sighted off the southern coast of <span>Ireland</span>. Ordinarily, however, the Melon-head is found beyond the <span>continental shelf</span> between 20&#xB0;&#xA0;S and 20&#xB0;&#xA0;N. <span>Hawaii</span> and <span>Cebu</span>, in the <span>Philippines</span>, are good sites for seeing the whale because the <span>continental shelf</span> there is narrow. Although no specific data exists, the species is unlikely to be migratory, in common with animals in its subfamily.</p>

<p>On February 10, 2009, over 300 melon-headed whales were spotted off the shallow waters of <span>Bataan</span>, in the <span>Philippines</span>. Local residents and volunteers guided the dolphins back to deeper waters. Although no definite explanation has been provided for the dolphins' behaviour, it's been noted that two of the three dead dolphins had damaged <span>ear drums</span>. Scientists from the International Whaling Commission claim that damage to the ear drums of melon-headed whales can be caused by high-power <span>sonar</span> equipment such as that used by <span>Exxon Mobil</span> when searching for oil.</p>
<p>In <span>Hawaii</span>, group sizes are variable, ranging from a single animal to pods of 800, but typically they are found in relatively large groups (median = 287 individuals). There appear to be two Hawaiian populations a large, deep water group that moves frequently among the islands and a small, shallow water population that stays near the island of Hawai<span class="unicode">&#x2BB;</span>i. Melon-headed whales are closely related to false killer whales, short-finned pilot whales and pygmy killer whales. Hawaiian melon-heads spend much of their daytime at the surface resting.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The melon-headed whale is included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (<span>Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU</span>) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (<span>Pacific Cetaceans MoU</span>)</p>
