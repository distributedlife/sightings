<p>The <b>White-winged Widowbird</b> (<i>Euplectes albonotatus</i>) is a species of <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Ploceidae</span> native to <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. It is highly <span>sexually dimorphic</span> in its breeding season, during which the male's yellow <span>plumage</span> turns dark and he gains more white feathers, contrasting with the female's predominantly pale coloration. Three subspecies are recognised.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The White-winged Widowbird was first described by the American <span>ornithologist</span> <span>John Cassin</span> in 1848. Hybrids with "red bishops", probably <span>Northern Red Bishop</span> (<i>E. franciscanus</i>), have been reported in captivity. Non-captive interbreeding of race <i>eques</i> with nominate appears to occur in southern <span>Tanzania</span>, but they appear to stay segregated in <span>Burundi</span> and western Tanzania. A proposal has been made for race <i>sassii</i>, which is found along the northwestern shore of <span>Lake Tanganyika</span>. Alternate common names include: White-fronted/White-shouldered Widowbird, White-winged/White-shouldered Whydah, Long-tailed Black Whydah.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Three subspecies of the White-winged Widowbird are now recognized.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The White-winged Widowbird is 15&#x2013;19&#xA0;cm (5.9&#x2013;7.5&#xA0;in) in length and about 23&#xA0;g (0.81&#xA0;oz) in weight. The male is the only short-tailed widowbird in its region with white on its <span>coverts</span>. The breeding male is distinguished from the <span>Yellow-mantled Widowbird</span> by its shorter tail, wing color, lack of yellow on its back, and paler bill. Females are pale below.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The White-winged Widowbird is found in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, S&#xE3;o Tom&#xE9;, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Its preferred habitats are <span>savanna</span>, grasslands and wetlands, as well as cultivated land. Its call is "zeh-zeh-zeh" and "witz-witz-witz".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The White-winged Widowbird is <span>polygynous</span>, with one male mating with 3&#x2013;4 females, and lives in flocks. Oval nests, built solely by the male, are located in the branches of trees or shrubs. Nesting takes place from November to May, peaking from December to March. The female will lay a <span>clutch</span> of two to four white eggs, which she will <span>incubate</span> for 12&#x2013;14 days. Feeding of chicks is done by the female in the nest for 11&#x2013;14 days, with chick independence coming 22&#x2013;25 days later. This bird mainly eats grass seeds, nectar, and insects.</p>
