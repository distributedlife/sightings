<p>The <b>Lizard Buzzard</b> (<i>Kaupifalco monogrammicus</i>) is a <span>bird of prey</span>. It belongs to the family <span>Accipitridae</span>. Despite its name, it may be more closely related to the <i><span>Accipiter</span></i> hawks than the <i><span>Buteo</span></i> buzzards.</p>
<p>The Lizard Buzzard occurs in tropical <span>Africa</span> south of the Sahara. It is a bird of open woodland, which builds a stick nest in the fork of a tree or the crown of a <span>palm tree</span>. The clutch is one to three <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>The Lizard Buzzard is a smallish stocky raptor at 36&#xA0;cm in length. The upperparts, head and breast are grey. There is a vertical black line on the white throat, which distinguishes this species from all other raptors. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The underwings are white with dark tips. The tail is black with a white tip and a single white band. Sexes are similar.</p>
<p>The Lizard Buzzard hunts mainly <span>reptiles</span> and large <span>insects</span>, but also small <span>mammals</span> and <span>birds</span>. It often sits quietly in the crown of an <span>Oil Palm</span> or on a telegraph wire. The call is a whistled <i>klu-klu-klu</i>.</p>
