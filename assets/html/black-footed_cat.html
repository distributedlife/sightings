<p>The black-footed cat is one of the smallest cat species. Adult resident males weigh on average 1.9&#xA0;kg (4.2&#xA0;lb) and a maximum of 2.45&#xA0;kg (5.4&#xA0;lb). Adult resident females weigh on average 1.3&#xA0;kg (2.9&#xA0;lb) and a maximum of 1.65&#xA0;kg (3.6&#xA0;lb). Males reach a head-to-body length of 36.7 to 43.3&#xA0;cm (14.4 to 17.0&#xA0;in) with tails 16.4 to 19.8&#xA0;cm (6.5 to 7.8&#xA0;in) long. Females are smaller with a maximum head-to-body-length of 36.9&#xA0;cm (14.5&#xA0;in) and taills 12.6 to 17.0&#xA0;cm (5.0 to 6.7&#xA0;in) long. The shoulder height is about 25 centimetres (9.8&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>Only the pads and underparts of its feet are black, which gives the black-footed cat its name. The <span>fur</span> varies in colour from cinnamon-buff to tawny, and is patterned with black or brown spots that merge to form rings on the legs, neck, and tail. The skin, however, is unpigmented pink, unlike that of other spotted cats. The backs of the rounded ears are the same color as the background coat color. The eyes are very large.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The black-footed cat is endemic to <span>southern Africa</span>, and primarily found in South Africa, <span>Namibia</span>, marginally into <span>Zimbabwe</span> and likely in extreme southern <span>Angola</span>. There are only historical but no recent records in <span>Botswana</span>. It lives in dry, open <span>savanna</span>, grassland and <span>Karoo</span> <span>semi-desert</span> with shrub and tree cover at altitudes of up to 2,000&#xA0;m (6,600&#xA0;ft), but not in the driest and sandiest parts of the <span>Namib</span> and <span>Kalahari Deserts</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_of_subspecies">Distribution of subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Two subspecies with different ranges are recognized:</p>

<p>According to Shortridge's description, <i>F. n. nigripes</i> is smaller and paler than <i>F. n. thomasi</i>. But since specimens with characteristics of both assumed subspecies are found close to <span>Kimberley</span> in central South Africa, the existence of subspecies is questioned, as there are no geographical or ecological barriers to their ranges.</p>

Adult black-footed cat resting</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Black-footed cats are solitary and strictly <span>nocturnal</span>, thus rarely seen. They spend the day resting in dense cover, in unoccupied <span>burrows</span> of <span>springhares</span>, <span>porcupines</span> and <span>aardvarks</span>, or in hollow <span>termite</span> mounds. They emerge to hunt after sunset.</p>
<p>They are typically found in dry, open habitat with some degree of vegetation cover. Apparently, they get all the moisture they need from their prey, but will drink water when available.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cats, black-footed cats are poor climbers, and will generally ignore tree branches. Their stocky bodies and short tails are not conducive to tree-climbing. They dig vigorously in the sand to extend or modify burrows for shelter.</p>
<p>Black-footed cats are highly unsociable animals that seek refuge at the slightest disturbance. When cornered, they are known to defend themselves fiercely. Due to this habit and their courage, they are called <i>miershooptier</i> (anthill animals) in parts of the South African Karoo, although they rarely use termite mounds for cover or for bearing their young. A <span>San</span> legend claims that a black-footed cat can kill a <span>giraffe</span> by piercing its <span>jugular</span>. This exaggeration is intended to emphasize the bravery and tenacity of the animal.</p>
<p>Within one year, a female covers an average range of 10&#xA0;km (3.9&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi), a resident male 22&#xA0;km (8.5&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). The range of an adult male overlaps the ranges of one to four females. On average, the animal travels 8&#xA0;km (5.0&#xA0;mi) per night in search of prey. The cats use <span>scent marking</span> throughout their ranges, with males <span>spraying urine</span> up to 12 times an hour. Other forms of scent marking include rubbing objects, raking with claws, and depositing <span>faeces</span> in visible locations. Their calls are louder than those of other cats of their size, presumably to allow them to call over relatively large distances. However, when close to each other, they use quieter purrs or gurgles, or hiss and growl if threatened.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet_and_hunting">Diet and hunting</span></h3>
<p>Due to their small size, black-footed cats hunt mainly small prey species, such as <span>rodents</span> and small <span>birds</span>, but may also take the <span>white-quilled bustard</span> and the <span>Cape hare</span>, the latter heavier than itself. <span>Insects</span> and <span>spiders</span> provide less than 1% of the prey mass consumed. They are unusually active hunters, killing up to 14 small animals in a night. Their <span>energy requirements</span> are very high, with about 250&#xA0;g (9&#xA0;oz) of prey per night consumed, which is about a sixth of its average body weight.</p>
<p>Black-footed cats hunt mainly by stalking, rather than ambush, using the cover of darkness and all available traces of cover to approach their prey before the final pounce. They have been observed to hunt by moving swiftly to flush prey from cover, but also to slowly stalk through tufts of vegetation. Less commonly, they will wait outside rodent burrows, often with their eyes closed, but remaining alert for the slightest sound. In common with the big cats, but unlike most other small species, black-footed cats have been observed to hide some of their captured prey for later feeding, rather than consuming it immediately.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction_and_life_cycle">Reproduction and life cycle</span></h3>
<p>Black-footed cats have lived for 10 years in captivity. Females reach <span>sexual maturity</span> after 8 to 12 months. They come into <span>estrus</span> for only one or two days at a time, and are <span>receptive to mating</span> for a few hours, requiring males to locate them quickly. Copulation occurs frequently during this period. <span>Gestation</span> lasts from 63 to 68 days. A <span>litter</span> consists usually of two kittens, but may vary from one to four young. Kittens weigh 60 to 84&#xA0;g (2.1 to 3.0&#xA0;oz) at birth. They are born blind and relatively helpless, although they are able to crawl about after just a few hours. They are able to walk within two weeks, begin taking solid food after about a month, and are fully <span>weaned</span> by two months of age.</p>
<p>Females may have up to two litters during the spring, summer and autumn. They rear their kittens in a burrow, moving them to new locations regularly after the first week. In general, kittens develop more rapidly than other similarly sized cats, quickly adapting them to a relatively hostile environment. They become independent by five months of age, but may remain within their mother's range.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p><i>Felis nigripes</i> is included on <span>CITES Appendix I</span> and protected by national legislation across most of its range. Hunting is banned in Botswana and South Africa.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_situ_research"><i>In situ</i> research</span></h3>
<p>The Black-footed Cat Working Group carries out a research project at Benfontein Nature Reserve and Nuwejaarsfontein Farm in central South Africa, where seven black-footed cats have been radio-collared. This project is part of a multidisciplinary effort to study the distribution, ecology, health, and reproduction of black-footed cats over an extended period. In November 2012, this project was extended to Biesiesfontein Farm located in the <span>Northern Cape Province</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_captivity">In captivity</span></h3>
<p><span>Wuppertal</span> Zoo acquired black-footed cats as long ago as 1957, and succeeded in breeding them in 1963. In 1993, the <span>European Endangered Species Programme</span> was formed to coordinate which animals are best suited for pairing to maintain genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding. The <i>International Studbook</i> for the black-footed cat is kept in the German Wuppertal Zoo. As of July 2011, there are detailed records for a total of 726 captive cats since 1964; worldwide 74 individuals were kept in 23 institutions in Germany, <span>United Arab Emirates</span>, USA, UK, and South Africa.</p>
<p>In February 2011, a female kept at the <span>Audubon Nature Institute</span> gave birth to two male kittens. This birth was significant in that the kittens are the first of their species to be born as a result of <span>in vitro fertilization</span> using frozen and thawed <span>sperm</span> and frozen and thawed embryos. In 2003, the sperm was collected from a male and then frozen. At the Audubon Nature Institute, it was later combined with an egg from a female, creating embryos in March 2005. Those embryos were frozen for almost six years before being thawed and transferred to a surrogate female in December 2010, which carried the embryos to term, resulting in the birth of the two kittens. Scientists hope this will provide a means to increase the species numbers, as well as introduce greater genetic variation into the small population.</p>
<p>In April 2011, the <span>Cleveland Metroparks Zoo</span> reported the births of black-footed cats.</p>
<p>In June 2011, the <span>Fresno Chaffee Zoo</span> reported recent births of black-footed cats.</p>
<p>On 6 February 2012, a female black-footed cat kitten, Crystal, was born to a domestic cat <span>surrogate</span> after interspecies <span>embryo transfer</span>.</p>
<p>In March 2012, the <span>Brookfield Zoo</span> reported the birth of a black-footed cat.</p>
<p>In April 2014, a litter of three black-footed cats was born at the <span>Philadelphia Zoo</span>.</p>
