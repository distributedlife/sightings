<p>The <b>Cape <span>cormorant</span></b> or <b>Cape shag</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax capensis</i>) is a bird <span>endemic</span> to the southwestern coasts of <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>It breeds from <span>Namibia</span> south to southern <span>Cape Province</span>. In the nonbreeding season, it may be found as far north as the mouth of the <span>Congo</span>, and also extends up the east coast of South Africa as far as <span>Mozambique</span>. In the 1970s, the breeding population was estimated as over 1 million in Namibia alone. However, the <span>IUCN</span> now classifies it as "Endangered" due to a very rapid decline in the population over the last three generations.</p>
<p>The Cape cormorant is an almost entirely glossy black bird, though in breeding condition it has a purplish tinge and a few white plumes on head, neck, and <span>cloacal</span> areas. Its <span>gular skin</span> is a deep orangey yellow; unusually for a cormorant, its <span>lores</span> are feathered. The bird's wing is about 240&#x2013;280&#xA0;mm in extent, and it weighs 800-1,600&#xA0;grams, with little <span>sexual dimorphism</span>.</p>
<p>Cape shags commonly forage in flocks, taking schooling fish from mid-water, such as <span>pilchards</span>, <span>anchovies</span>, and <span>sandeels</span>. Its prey are typically much smaller than those of the sympatric <span>bank cormorant</span>. Their major predators are <span>black-backed jackals</span>, which take the occasional adult while it is roosting, and nest-site predators such as <span>great cormorants</span>, <span>eastern great white pelicans</span>, and <span>kelp gulls</span>.</p>
<p>Like a number of other related cormorant species, the Cape cormorant is placed by some authorities (e.g. Johnsgaard) in the genus <i><span>Leucocarbo</span></i>.</p>
