<p>The <b>Livingstone's Turaco</b> (<i>Tauraco livingstonii</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Musophagidae</span> family, which was named for <span>Charles Livingstone</span>, the brother of <span>David Livingstone</span>.</p>
<p>It is distributed through the subtropical lowlands of southeastern Africa. It has an isolated population in <span>Burundi</span>, and is besides found from southern <span>Tanzania</span> to eastern and southern <span>Malawi</span>, eastern <span>Zimbabwe</span>, widely in <span>Mozambique</span> and along the subtropical coast of <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>By appearances and behaviour it has much in common with the <span>Knysna Turaco</span> of South Africa, and <span>Schalow's Turaco</span> which replaces it on the plateau regions to the west of its range.</p>
