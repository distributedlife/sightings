<p>The <b>southern reedbuck</b>, <b>rietbok</b> or <b>common reedbuck</b> (<i>Redunca arundinum</i>) is a <span>diurnal</span> <span>antelope</span> typically found in southern <span>Africa</span>. It was first described by <span>Pieter Boddaert</span>, a Dutch physician and naturalist, in 1785. It is placed in the genus <i><span>Redunca</span></i> and family <span>Bovidae</span>. This antelope has an average mass of 58&#xA0;kg (128&#xA0;lb) and a body length of about 134&#x2013;167&#xA0;cm (53&#x2013;66&#xA0;in).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_etymology">Taxonomy and etymology</span></h2>
<p>It was first described by <span>Pieter Boddaert</span>, a Dutch physician and naturalist, in 1785. It is placed in the genus <i><span>Redunca</span></i> and family <span>Bovidae</span>. It gets its name from two <span>Latin</span> words: <i>reduncas</i> (meaning bent backwards and curved, while the horns are bent forwards) and <i>arundo</i> (harundo) (meaning a <span>reed</span>; hence <i>arundinum</i>, pertaining to <span>reeds</span>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The southern reedbuck is larger than the other species in <i>Redunca</i>, namely <i><span>R. redunca</span></i> (Bohor reeduck) and <i><span>R. fulvorufula</span></i> (mountain reedbuck). It stands 80&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm (31&#x2013;35&#xA0;in) at the shoulder. Females weigh 48&#xA0;kg (106&#xA0;lb), while the males weigh 68&#xA0;kg (150&#xA0;lb). It has distinctive dark lines running down the front of each of its <span>forelegs</span> and lower <span>hindlegs</span> and whitish rings around the eyes. It has a <span>lifespan</span> of 10 years.</p>
<p>The coat is silky and almost woolly. The color of its <span>coat</span> ranges between light- and greyish-brown, and may be lighter on the neck and chest. A small, black, bare <span>glandular</span> patch can be noticed at the base of each ear. White fur covers the underparts and the areas near the lips and chin. The tail is white underside, and appears short and bushy. Southern reedbucks measure an average of 85&#xA0;cm (33&#xA0;in) at the shoulder. Females lack <span>horns</span>. Males bear forward-curving horns, about 35&#x2013;45&#xA0;cm (14&#x2013;18&#xA0;in) long, with the base having a distinct band of pale, rubbery <span>tissue</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>Southern reedbucks live in pairs or alone. Sometimes, they form <span>herds</span> consisting of about 20 members. They prefer to lie in <span>grass</span> or <span>reed</span> beds in the heat of the day and feed during <span>sunrise</span> and <span>sunset</span>, or sometimes even at <span>night</span>. Old reedbucks are permanently <span>territorial</span>, with territories around 35-60 hectares, and generally live with a single female, preventing contact with rival males. Females and young males perform an 'appeasement dance' for older males. During the dance, the bucks run around speedily and take considerably long jumps, with the tail curled up and scented air being released from a pocket in the <span>groin</span> at every bounce, making a popping sound. Within this territory, it is active all the time in summer, but it is <span>nocturnal</span> in the wet season. It regularly uses paths to reach good sites to rest, graze, and drink water. Average lifetime home ranges have been estimated as 123 ha for females and 74 ha for males.</p>
<p>Their main <span>predators</span> include <span>lions</span>, <span>leopards</span>, <span>cheetahs</span>, <span>spotted hyenas</span>, <span>Cape hunting dogs</span>, <span>pythons</span>, and <span>crocodiles</span>. They can camouflage themselves in the grasslands due to their <span>coats</span>, which are almost the same color. If startled or attacked, they stand still, then either hide or flee with an odd rocking-horse movement, and cautiously look back to ensure the danger is gone, generally. They use <span>vocalizations</span> like a shrill whistle through their <span>nostrils</span> and a clicking noise to alert others about danger.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>As a <span>herbivore</span>, the reedbuck mainly feeds on <span>grasses</span>. It also eats <span>herbs</span> and <span>reeds</span>. It never enters into water, though it inhabits places with water sources. It needs to drink water every few days to several times a day during the dry season.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>The southern reedbuck breeds almost all the time of the year, although most <span>matings</span> occur during the hot and wet season. Females reach <span>sexual maturity</span> when they are two years old, when they leave their parent&#x2019;s territory. Males, which reach maturity at a slightly older age, may remain with the family group until their third year. A single young is born per birth after a <span>gestation</span> period of seven to eight months, and remains amongst the dense and tall grass cover in which it was born for the next two months. The female does not stay with her young, but instead visits it for just 10 to 30 minutes each day to nurse it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_distribution">Habitat and distribution</span></h2>
<p>Southern reedbucks have a wide distribution, stretching from <span>Gabon</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> to <span>South Africa</span>. Their range seems to extend to the <span>Miombo woodlands</span> on the north. They inhabit moist <span>grasslands</span> with tall grass, <span>reeds</span>, sufficient cover, and water nearby, such as <span>floodplains</span>, <span>pastures</span>, <span>woodlands</span>, and <span>valleys</span>. They are common in seasonally flooded valleys near the <span>Malagarasi River</span>. They also occur in the southern savannas of <span>Tchibanga</span> and Ndende (in <span>Zaire</span>).</p>
<p>It is native to <span>Angola</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, the <span>Republic of the Congo</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, Gabon, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, South Africa, <span>Swaziland</span>, Tanzania, <span>Zambia</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>. It also occurs in protected areas and areas with low to moderate levels of settlement, including significant populations on private land in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Namibia. In the Republic of Congo, it formerly occurred locally in the <span>savannahs</span> of southern Congo, but it is probably extinct there by now. Its presence is doubted in <span>Lesotho</span>. Major populations occur in areas such as <span>Selous National Park</span> (Tanzania), <span>Kafue National Park</span> (Zambia), <span>Nyika National Park</span> (Malawi), <span>Gorongosa National Park</span> (Mozambique), Okavango National Park (Botswana) and <span>Kruger National Park</span> and <span>Eastern Shores</span> (South Africa).</p>

<i><span>Setaria graberi</span></i> (<span>Nematoda</span>, <span>Filarioidea</span>), a parasite of the reedbuck in <span>South Africa</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Southern reedbucks remain widespread, but they have been eliminated from some parts of their former range (such as the Congo) by the spread of <span>settlement</span> which has led to <span>habitat destruction</span> and hunting for meat and trophies. It is reportedly one of the easiest <span>antelopes</span> to approach and kill. About 60% of all southern reedbucks are thought to occur in <span>protected areas</span> and about 13% on private lands. This combination of <span>habitat loss</span> and <span>overexploitation</span> has resulted in the species becoming rare in most of South Africa, and reduced populations to precariously low levels in west and central Africa; those in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo are feared to be almost extinct.<br/>
Parasites of reedbucks include the <span>filaria</span> <i><span>Setaria graberi</span></i>.</p>
