<p>The <b>common eland</b> (<i>Taurotragus oryx</i>), also known as the <b>southern eland</b> or <b>eland antelope</b>, is a <span>savannah</span> and <span>plains</span> <span>antelope</span> found in <span>East</span> and <span>Southern Africa</span>. It is a species of the family <span>Bovidae</span> and genus <i><span>Taurotragus</span></i>. It was first described by <span>Peter Simon Pallas</span> in 1766. An adult male is around 1.6&#xA0;metres (5') tall at the shoulder (females are 20&#xA0;centimetres (8") shorter) and can weigh up to 942&#xA0;kg (2077&#xA0;lbs) with an average of 500&#x2013;600&#xA0;kilograms (1,100&#x2013;1,300&#xA0;lb, 340&#x2013;445&#xA0;kilograms (750&#x2013;980&#xA0;lb) for females). It is the second largest antelope in the world, being slightly smaller on average than the <span>giant eland</span>.</p>
<p>Mainly an <span>herbivore</span>, its diet is primarily <span>grasses</span> and <span>leaves</span>. Common elands form herds of up to 500 animals, but are not <span>territorial</span>. The common eland prefers <span>habitats</span> with a wide variety of <span>flowering plants</span> such as savannah, <span>woodlands</span>, and open and <span>montane</span> <span>grasslands</span>; it avoids dense <span>forests</span>. It uses loud barks, visual and postural movements and the <span>flehmen response</span> to <span>communicate</span> and warn others of danger. The common eland provides <span>leather</span> and rich, nutritious milk, and has been <span>domesticated</span> in many areas.</p>
<p>It is native to <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Burundi</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>South Sudan</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Zambia</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span> but is no longer present in <span>Burundi</span> and <span>Angola</span>. The common eland's population is decreasing but it is classified as "<span>Least Concern</span>" by the <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> (IUCN).</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The scientific name of the common eland is <i>Taurotragus oryx</i>, composed of three words: <i>tauros</i>, <i>tragos</i> and <i>oryx</i>. <i>Tauros</i> is <span>Greek</span> for a bull or bullock, meaning the same as the <span>Latin</span> <i>taurus</i>. <i>Tragos</i> is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. <i>Oryx</i> is Latin and Greek (generally <i>orygos</i>) for <span>pickaxe</span>, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and <span>scimitar-horned oryx</span>.</p>
<p>The name 'eland' is <span>Dutch</span> for "elk" or "moose". It has a <span>Baltic</span> source similar to the <span>Lithuanian</span> <i>&#xE9;lnis</i>, which means "deer". It was borrowed earlier as <i>ellan</i> (<span>French</span>) in the 1610s or <i>Elend</i> (<span>German</span>). When <span>Dutch</span> settlers came to the Cape Province they named it after the large, herbivorous <span>moose</span>. In <span>Dutch</span> the animal is called "Eland antelope" to distinguish it from the moose, which is found in the northern boreal forests.</p>

Common eland bull</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Common elands are spiral-horned antelopes. They are <span>sexually dimorphic</span>, with females being smaller than the males. Females weigh 300&#x2013;600&#xA0;kg (660&#x2013;1,320&#xA0;lb), measure 200&#x2013;280&#xA0;cm (79&#x2013;110&#xA0;in) from the snout to the base of the tail and stand 125&#x2013;153&#xA0;cm (49&#x2013;60&#xA0;in) at the shoulder. Bulls weigh 400&#x2013;942&#xA0;kg (882&#x2013;2,077&#xA0;lb), are 240&#x2013;345&#xA0;cm (94&#x2013;136&#xA0;in) from the snout to the base of the tail and stand 150&#x2013;183&#xA0;cm (59&#x2013;72&#xA0;in) at the shoulder. The tail is 50&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;35&#xA0;in) long. Male elands can weigh up to 1,000&#xA0;kg (2,200&#xA0;lb).</p>
<p>Their coat differs geographically with elands in north Africa having distinctive markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. The coat is smooth except for a rough mane. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls may also have a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the <span>Karoo</span> in <span>South Africa</span>). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense <span>fur</span> on their foreheads and a large <span>dewlap</span> on their throats.</p>
<p>Both sexes have horns with a steady spiral ridge (resembling that of the <span>bushbuck</span>). The horns are visible as small buds in newborns and grow rapidly during the first seven months. The horns of males are thicker and shorter than those of females (males' horns are 43&#x2013;66 centimetres (17&#x2013;26&#xA0;in) long and females' are 51&#x2013;69 centimetres (20&#x2013;27&#xA0;in) long), and have a tighter spiral. Males use their horns during <span>rutting season</span> to wrestle and <span>butt heads</span> with rivals, while females use their horns to protect their young from predators.</p>
<p>The common eland is the slowest antelope, with a peak speed of 40 kilometres (25&#xA0;mi) per hour that tires them quickly. However, they can maintain a 22 kilometres (14&#xA0;mi) per hour <span>trot</span> indefinitely. Elands are capable of jumping up to 2.5 metres (8&#xA0;ft 2&#xA0;in) from a standing start when startled (up to 3 metres (9.8&#xA0;ft) for young elands). The common eland's life expectancy is generally between 15 and 20 years; in captivity some live up to 25 years.</p>
<p>Eland herds are accompanied by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that the weight of the animal causes the two halves of its <span>hooves</span> to splay apart, and the clicking is the result of the hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The common eland was first described in 1766 by the German <span>zoologist</span> and <span>botanist</span> <span>Peter Simon Pallas</span>. It belongs to the order <span>Artiodactyla</span>, family <span>Bovidae</span> and subfamily <span>Bovinae</span>. Common elands are sometimes considered part of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Tragelaphus</span></i> on the basis of <span>molecular phylogenetics</span>, but are usually categorized as <i><span>Taurotragus</span></i>, along with the <span>giant eland</span> (<i>T. derbianus</i>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Three subspecies of common eland have been recognized, though their validity has been in dispute.</p>


<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diseases_and_parasites">Diseases and parasites</span></h2>
<p>Common elands are resistant to <span>trypanosomiasis</span>, a protozoan infection that has the <span>tsetse fly</span> as a <span>vector</span>, but not to the <i><span>Rhipicephalus</span></i>-transmitted disease <span>theileriosis</span>. The disease-causing bacteria <i>Theileria taurotragi</i> has caused many eland deaths. <i><span>Clostridium chauvoei</span></i>, another bacterium, can be harmful as well. Elands are also hosts to several kinds of <span>ticks</span>. In one study an eland was found to be host to the <i><span>Amblyomma</span></i> species <i>A. gemma</i> and <i>A. variegatum</i>, and <i><span>Rhipicephalus</span></i> species <i>R. decoloratus</i>, <i>R. appendiculatus</i>, <i>R. evertsi</i>, <i>R. pulchellus</i> and <i>R. pravus</i>. Elands produce <span>antibodies</span> for <span>Brucella</span> bacteria, but none for <i><span>Mycobacterium paratuberculosis</span></i> or various types of <span>pneumonia</span> like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetics_and_evolution">Genetics and evolution</span></h2>
<p>Male elands have 31 <span>diploid</span> chromosomes and females have 32. The male (Y) chromosome has been <span>translocated</span> to the <span>short arm</span> of an <span>autosome</span>. Both the <span>X</span> and <span>Y</span> <span>replicate</span> late; they do not match well and are variable. The chromosomes resemble those of the <span>greater kudu</span> (<i>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</i>).</p>
<p>Male elands and female greater kudus can produce a viable male <span>hybrid</span>, though it is not known if it is <span>sterile</span>. An accidental crossing of an east African common eland (<i>T. o. pattersonianus'</i>) with an east African kudu (<i>T. s. bea</i>) occurred in the <span>San Diego Zoo Safari Park</span>. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was <span>sterile</span>, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with <span>domestic</span> (<i>Bos primigenius</i>) and <span>zebu</span> cows (<i>Bos indicus</i>) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as <span>surrogates</span> for <span>bongos</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>Bovidae</span> <span>family</span> ancestors of the common eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in <span>Africa</span>; <span>fossils</span> are found throughout Africa and <span>France</span> but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the <span>tribe</span> <i>Tragelaphini</i> appear 6 million years in the past during the <span>late Miocene</span>. An extinct ancestor of the common eland (<i>Taurotragus arkelli</i>) appears in the <span>Pleistocene</span> in northern <span>Tanzania</span> and the first <i>T. oryx</i> fossil appears in the <span>Holocene</span> in <span>Algeria</span>.</p>
<p>In 2010, a genetic study was made basing on the evolutionary history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna <span>biome</span> of east and southern Africa, the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals to learn more about various topics such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and a mosaic of <span>Pleistocene</span> refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity of dates obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species.</p>

Common elands resting in herds.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Common elands are <span>nomadic</span> and <span>crepuscular</span>. They eat in the morning and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in sunlight when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. <span>Juveniles</span> and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During <span>estrus</span>, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of <span>zebras</span>, <span>roan antelopes</span> and <span>oryxes</span>.</p>
<p>Common elands <span>communicate</span> via gestures, vocalizations, <span>scent cues</span> and <span>display behaviors</span>. The <span>flehmen response</span> also occurs, primarily in males in response to contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, as well as to indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt to attract the attention of others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main <span>predators</span> include <span>lions</span>, <span>wild dogs</span>, <span>cheetahs</span> and <span>spotted hyenas</span>. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.</p>

Distribution of the common eland over the <span>savannas</span> and <span>plains</span> in eastern and southern <span>Africa</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Common elands live on the open plains of southern Africa and along the foothills of the great southern African plateau. The species extends north into <span>Ethiopia</span> and most arid zones of <span>Sudan</span>, east into western <span>Angola</span> and <span>Namibia</span>, and south to <span>South Africa</span>. However, there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.</p>
<p>Elands prefer to live in semi-arid areas that contain many shrub-like bushes, and often inhabit grasslands, woodlands, sub-desert, bush, and mountaintops with altitudes of about 15,000&#xA0;ft (4600&#xA0;m). Elands do, however, avoid forests, swamps and deserts. The places inhabited by elands generally contain <i><span>Acacia</span></i>, <i><span>Combretum</span></i>, <i><span>Commiphora</span></i>, <i><span>Diospyros</span></i>, <i><span>Grewia</span></i>, <i><span>Rhus</span></i> and <i><span>Ziziphus</span></i> trees and shrubs; some of these also serve as their food.</p>
<p>Elands can be found in many National Parks and reserves today, including <span>Nairobi</span> and Tsavo National Park, <span>Masai Mara NR</span>, <span>Kenya</span>; <span>Serengeti</span>, <span>Ruaha</span> and <span>Tarangire National Park</span>, Ngorongoro Crater, <span>Tanzania</span>; <span>Kagera National Park</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>; <span>Nyika National Park</span>, <span>Malawi</span>; <span>Luangwa Valley</span> and <span>Kafue National Park</span>, <span>Zambia</span>; <span>Hwange National Park</span>, <span>Matobo National Park</span>, <span>Tuli Safari Area</span> and <span>Chimanimani Eland Sanctuary</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>; <span>Kruger National Park</span>, <span>Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park</span>, <span>Giant's Castle</span> and <span>Suikerbosrand NR</span>, <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>They live on home ranges that can be 200&#x2013;400&#xA0;km for females and <span>juveniles</span> and 50&#xA0;km for males.</p>

Elands are mainly grazers.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Common elands are <span>herbivores</span> that <span>browse</span> during drier winter months but have also adapted to <span>grazing</span> during the rainy season when grasses are more common. They require a high-<span>protein</span> diet of <span>succulent</span> leaves from <span>flowering plants</span> but will consume lower quality plant material if available including <span>forbs</span>, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include <i><span>Setaria</span></i> and <i><span>Themeda</span></i> and fruits from <i><span>Securinega</span></i> and <i><span>Strychnos</span></i>. Large antelopes can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.</p>
<p>Most of their water is obtained from their food, though they will drink water when available. As they quickly adjust to the surroundings due to seasonal changes and other causes, they also change their feeding habits. They also use their horns to break off branches that are hard to reach.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Females are <span>sexually mature</span> at 15&#x2013;36 months and males at 4&#x2013;5 years. <span>Mating</span> may occur anytime after reaching sexual maturity, but is mostly seen in the rainy season. In <span>Zambia</span>, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating with each other in separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in <span>estrus</span>. They also test the female's urine. Usually a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2&#x2013;4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a <span>gestation</span> period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.</p>
<p>Males, females and juveniles each form separate social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together and search for food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy <span>plains</span> in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex <span>linear hierarchy</span>. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they are at least two years old and join a male or female group.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and regulated in international trade by the <span>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</span>. Using ground counts and <span>aerial surveys</span>, the <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Malawi</span> and possibly <span>Tanzania</span>.</p>
<p>The population is, however, gradually decreasing due to habitat loss, caused by expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat. As they are docile and inactive most of the time, they can easily be killed. The species became extinct in <span>Swaziland</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span>, but has been reintroduced.</p>
<p>The IUCN states that about half of the estimated total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include <span>Omo</span> (<span>Ethiopia</span>), <span>Serengeti</span>, Katavi, <span>Ruaha</span> and Selous-Kilombero (<span>Tanzania</span>), <span>Kafue</span> and North Luangwa (<span>Zambia</span>), <span>Nyika</span> (<span>Malawi</span>), <span>Etosha</span> (<span>Namibia</span>), <span>Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park</span> (<span>Botswana</span>/<span>South Africa</span>) and <span>Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park</span> (<span>South Africa</span>). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common eland now live on private land, particularly in <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>South Africa</span>, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in <span>Zimbabwe</span>, <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Kenya</span>, as well as in <span>Russia</span>, <span>Ukraine</span> and <span>England</span>.</p>

<p>The common eland is sometimes farmed and hunted for its meat, and in some cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from <span>cattle</span> to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the <span>coat of arms</span> of <span>Grootfontein</span>, <span>Namibia</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Husbandry">Husbandry</span></h3>
<p>Common elands have a mild <span>temperament</span> and have been successfully <span>domesticated</span> for meat and milk production in <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Russia</span>. Their need for water is quite low because they produce <span>urine</span> with a high-<span>urea</span> content, but they require a substantial grazing area, along with <span>salt licks</span> and large amounts of supplementary foods like <span>maize</span>, <span>sorghum</span>, <span>melons</span> and <span>beans</span> which can be expensive. A female can produce up to 7 kilograms (15&#xA0;lb) of milk per day that is richer in <span>milkfat</span> than cow milk. The pleasant-tasting milk has a <span>butterfat</span> content of 11-17% and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared, versus several days for cow milk.</p>
<p>Housing common elands is difficult due to their ability to jump over fences as tall as 3 metres (9.8&#xA0;ft) or simply break through using their substantial mass. Sometimes wild elands will break through enclosures to mix with domesticated ones. Common elands can reproduce in captivity, but calf survival is low and the young may need to be separated from their mothers to ensure health and adequate feeding. <span>Husbandry</span> requires care because the generally placid animals startle easily and require large amounts of space.</p>
