<p>The <b>rock hyrax</b> or <b>rock badger</b> (<i>Procavia capensis</i>; also called the <b>Cape hyrax</b>) is one of the four living species of the <span>order</span> <span>Hyracoidea</span>, and the only living species in the genus <i>Procavia</i>. Like all <span>hyraxes</span>, it is a medium-sized (~4&#xA0;kg) terrestrial mammal, superficially resembling a <span>guinea pig</span> with short ears and tail. The closest living relatives to hyraxes are the modern-day <span>elephants</span> and <span>sirenians</span>. The rock hyrax is found across <span>Africa</span> and the <span>Middle East</span>, in habitats with rock crevices in which to escape from predators. Hyraxes typically live in groups of 10&#x2013;80 animals, and <span>forage</span> as a group. They have been reported to use sentries: one or more animals take up position on a vantage point and issue alarm calls on the approach of <span>predators</span>.</p>
<p>The rock hyrax has incomplete <span>thermoregulation</span>, and is most active in the morning and evening, although their activity pattern varies substantially with season and climate.</p>
<p>Over most of its range, the rock hyrax is not endangered, and in some areas is considered a minor pest. In <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Israel</span> and <span>Jordan</span>, they have been shown to be a reservoir of the <span>leishmaniasis</span> parasite.</p>

The unusual <span>incisors</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The rock hyrax is squat and heavily built, adults reaching a length of 50&#xA0;cm (20&#xA0;in) and weighing around 4&#xA0;kg (8.8&#xA0;lb), with a slight <span>sexual dimorphism</span>, males being approximately 10% heavier than females. Their fur is thick and grey-brown, although this varies strongly between different environments: from dark brown in wetter habitats, to light gray in desert living individuals. Hyrax size (as measured by <span>skull</span> length and <span>humerus</span> diameter) is correlated to <span>precipitation</span>, probably because of the effect on preferred hyrax <span>forage</span>.</p>
<p>Prominent in and apparently unique to hyraxes is the dorsal gland, which excretes an odour used for social communication and <span>territorial</span> marking. The gland is most clearly visible in dominant males.</p>
<p>The head of the rock hyrax is pointed, having a short neck with rounded ears. They have long black whiskers on their muzzles. The rock hyrax has a prominent pair of long, pointed <span>tusk</span>-like upper <span>incisors</span> which are reminiscent of the <span>elephant</span>, to which the hyrax is distantly related. The forefeet are <span>plantigrade</span>, and the hindfeet semi-<span>digitigrade</span>. The soles of the feet have large, soft pads that are kept moist with sweat-like secretions. In males, the <span>testes</span> are permanently abdominal, another anatomical feature that hyraxes share with their relatives <span>elephants</span> and <span>sirenians</span>.</p>
<p><span>Thermoregulation</span> in the rock hyrax has been subject to much research, as their body temperature varies with a <span>diurnal</span> rhythm. However, animals kept in constant environmental conditions also display such variation and this internal mechanism may be related to water balance regulation.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The rock hyrax occurs across <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>, with the exception of the <span>Congo basin</span> and <span>Madagascar</span>. A larger, longer-haired subspecies is abundant in the glacial <span>moraines</span> in the alpine zone of <span>Mount Kenya</span>. The distribution continues into northern <span>Algeria</span>, <span>Libya</span> and <span>Egypt</span>, and the <span>Middle East</span>, with populations in <span>Israel</span>, <span>Jordan</span>, <span>Syria</span>, the <span>Arabian peninsula</span> and eastern <span>Turkey</span>.</p>
<p>A mammal of similar appearance by convergent evolution, but unrelated, is the <span>Rock cavy</span> of Brazil.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology_and_behaviour">Ecology and behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Hyraxes live in colonies of up to 80 individuals. These colonies are subdivided into smaller groups consisting of a few families. These consist of 3 to 15 related adult females, a dominant male, and several young. The dominant male defends and watches over the group. The male also marks its territory.</p>
<p>In Africa, hyraxes are preyed on by <span>leopards</span>, <span>Egyptian cobras</span>, <span>puff adders</span>, <span>Rock pythons</span>, <span>caracals</span>, <span>wild dogs</span>, and <span>eagles</span>. <span>Verreaux's Eagle</span> in particular is a specialist hunter of hyrax. In Israel, the rock hyrax is reportedly rarely preyed upon by terrestrial predators, as their system of sentries and their reliable refuges provide considerable protection. Hyrax remains are almost absent from the <span>droppings</span> of <span>wolves</span> in the <span>Judean Desert</span>.</p>

Hyrax making a chewing motion</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hyraxes feed on a wide variety of different plants, including both <span>grasses</span> and <span>broad-leafed plants</span>. They also have been reported to eat insects and grubs. The rock hyraxes forage for food up to about 50 metres from their refuge, usually feeding as a group and with one or more acting as sentries from a prominent lookout position. On the approach of danger, the sentries give an alarm call, and the animals quickly retreat to their refuge. They are able to go for many days without water due to the moisture they obtain through their food. Despite their seemingly clumsy build, they are able to climb trees (although not as readily as <span>Heterohyrax</span>), and will readily enter residential gardens to feed on the leaves of <span>citrus</span> and other trees.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>Rock hyraxes give birth to two or three young after a <span>gestation</span> period of 6&#x2013;7 months (long, for their size). The young are well developed at birth with fully opened eyes and complete <span>pelage</span>. Young can ingest solid food after two weeks and are weaned at ten weeks. After 16 months, the rock hyraxes become sexually mature, they reach adult size at three years, and they typically live about ten years. During seasonal changes, the weight of the male reproductive organs (testis, seminal vesicles) changes due to sexual activity. A study showed that between May and January, the males were inactive sexually. From February onward, there was a dramatic increase to the weight of these organs, and the males are able to copulate.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_behaviour">Social behaviour</span></h3>
<p>Rock hyraxes are very noisy and sociable. In a study of their social networks, it was found that hyraxes that live in more "egalitarian" groups, in which social associations are spread more evenly among group members, survive longer. In addition, hyraxes are the first non-human species in which <span>structural balance</span> was described, i.e. they follow the "the friend of my friend is my friend" rule, and avoid unbalanced social configurations.</p>
<p>Adults make use of at least 21 different vocal signals. The most familiar signal is a high trill, given in response to perceived danger. Rock hyrax calls can provide important biological information such as size, age, social status, body weight, condition, and hormonal state of the caller, as determined by measuring their call length, patterns, complexity, and frequency. More recently, researchers have found rich syntactic structure and geographical variations in the calls of rock hyraxes, a first in the vocalization of mammalian taxa other than primates, cetaceans, and bats.</p>
<p>The rock hyrax also makes a loud grunting sound while moving its jaws as if chewing, and this behaviour may be a sign of <span>aggression</span>. Some authors have proposed that observation of this behavior by ancient <span>Israelites</span> gave rise to the misconception given in <span>Leviticus</span> 11:4-8 that the hyrax <span>chews the cud</span>; in fact, hyraxes are not ruminants.</p>
<p>The rock hyrax spends approximately 95% of its time resting. During this time, they can often be seen basking in the sun, which is thought to be an element of their complex thermoregulation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispersal">Dispersal</span></h3>
<p>Male hyraxes have been categorised into four classes: territorial, peripheral, early dispersers, and late dispersers. The territorial males are dominant. Peripheral males are more solitary and sometimes take over a group when the dominant male is missing. Early-dispersing males are juveniles that leave the birth site around 16 to 24 months of age. Late dispersers are also juvenile males, but they leave the birth site much later; around 30 or more months of age.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h2>
<p>They are known as <b>dassies</b> in South Africa, and sometimes <b>rock rabbits</b>. The <span>Swahili</span> names for them are <b>pimbi</b>, <b>pelele</b> and <b>wibari</b>, though the latter two names are nowadays reserved for the <span>tree hyraxes</span>. The Dutch name is <b>klipdas</b>. This species has many subspecies, many of which are also known as rock or Cape hyrax, although the former usually refers to African varieties. In <span>Arabic</span>, the rock hyrax is called &#x627;&#x644;&#x648;&#x628;&#x631; ("wabr") or &#x637;&#x628;&#x633;&#x648;&#x646; ("tabsoun"). In <span>Hebrew</span>, the rock hyrax is called &#x5E9;&#x5E4;&#x5DF; &#x5E1;&#x5DC;&#x5E2; (<i>shafan sela</i>), meaning <i>rock "shafan"</i>, where the meaning of <i>shafan</i> is obscure, but is <span>colloquially</span> used as a synonym for <span>rabbit</span> in modern Hebrew. <span>Gerald Durrell</span> wrote that in <span>Bafut</span>, in <span>Cameroon</span>, the locals call the rock hyrax the <b>n'eer</b>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Naturopathic_use">Naturopathic use</span></h2>
<p>Rock hyraxes produce large quantities of <span>hyraceum</span>&#x2014;a sticky mass of dung and urine that has been employed as a South African folk remedy in the treatment of several medical <span>disorders</span>, including <span>epilepsy</span> and <span>convulsions</span>. <span>Hyraceum</span> is now being used by perfumers who tincture it in alcohol to yield a natural animal <span>musk</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
<p>Rock hyraxes are classified as non-<span>kosher</span> in the Old Testament/Jewish <span>Torah</span>. Nonetheless, they are also included in Proverbs 30:26 as one of a number of remarkable animals for being small but exceedingly wise, in this case because "the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs".</p>
<p>In <span>Joy Adamson</span>'s books and the associated movie <i><span>Born Free</span></i>, a rock hyrax that she called Pati-Pati was her companion for six years before <span>Elsa</span> and her siblings came along and took the role of nanny and watched over them with great care.</p>
