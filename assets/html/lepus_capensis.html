<p>The <b>Cape</b>, <b>common</b> or <b>brown hare</b> (<i>Lepus capensis</i>) is a <span>hare</span> natively found throughout <span>Africa</span>, and has spread to many parts of <span>Europe</span>, the <span>Middle East</span> and <span>Asia</span>. The Cape hare is a <span>nocturnal</span> <span>herbivore</span>. It is known in <span>French</span> as <b>li&#xE8;vre du Cap</b> and in <span>Spanish</span> as <b>liebre del Cabo</b>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>There are twelve subspecies that exist in Africa. These include:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Hare is a typical hare, with well-developed legs for leaping and running, and large eyes and ears to look out for threats from its environment. There is usually a white ring around the eye. It has a fine, soft coat which varies in colour from light brown to reddish to sandy grey. Unusually among mammals, the female is larger than the male; this phenomenon is called <span>sexual dimorphism</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>It may be found in <span>macchia</span>-type vegetation, <span>grassland</span>, <span>bushveld</span>, and <span>semi-desert</span> areas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>The Cape Hare is a herbivore, typically eating grass and shrubs of various types. <span>Coprophagy</span>, the consumption of fecal material, is a common behaviour amongst rabbits and hares. This habit allows the animal to extract the maximum nourishment from its diet, and microbes present in the pellets also provide nutrients.</p>
<p>Like other hares, they are fast. The only predator which is capable of outrunning them is the <span>cheetah</span>. All other predators are <span>ambush</span> and/or opportunistic hunters; examples of these are <span>leopards</span>, <span>caracals</span>, and <span>black-backed jackals</span>.</p>
<p>After a 42-day-long pregnancy, the female gives birth to from one to three young, termed <span>leverets</span>, per litter and may have as many as 4 litters per year. A characteristic of hares which differentiates them from rabbits is that the young are born <span>precocial</span>; that is, the young are born with eyes open and are able to move about shortly after birth. The Cape Hare is no exception in this regard.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>Because of its large range, the Cape Hare is evaluated by IUCN as "Least Concern", although the population trend is decreasing.</p>
