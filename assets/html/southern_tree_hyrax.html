<p>The <b>southern tree hyrax</b>(<i>Dendrohyrax arboreus</i>) or also known as the <b>eastern tree dassie</b>, <b>eastern tree hyrax</b>, <b>southern tree dassie</b> is a species of <span>mammal</span> in the family <span>Procaviidae</span>. The southern tree hyrax is mainly found in the south central eastern side of <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_Description">Physical Description</span></h2>
<p>The southern tree hyrax has a guinea pig-like appearance. It has long, soft, grey-brown fur that covers the body, while the underside is paler. Hairs are lighter near their tips and the ears have a fringe of white hair. They weigh about 2.27&#xA0;kg on average, and have an average length of 520&#xA0;mm.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_Habitat">Range and Habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is found in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>. Its natural <span>habitats</span> are temperate <span>forests</span>, subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist <span>montane forests</span>, moist <span>savanna</span>, and rocky areas. It may be found at elevations up to 4500 m</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Arboreal_Behavior">Arboreal Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The tree hyrax lives in trees and is mostly nocturnal, as opposed to the <span>rock hyrax</span> which lives among rocks and is mainly diurnal. It occurs singly, in pairs or in small groups, favouring hollow trees and dense foliage. Though an extremely able climber, it is awkward on the ground and walks with some difficulty. Its extraordinary call, heard mainly at night, is a series of blood-curdling shrieks building up to a crescendo. These territorial calls are produced mainly by the males.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Predation">Predation</span></h2>
<p>Martial and Tawny eagles, leopards, lions, jackals, spotted hyenas, and snakes prey upon the southern tree hyrax. In Rwanda, the most common predators are feral dogs. It has been speculated that the limited amount of time the hyrax spends on the ground at night may be a predator avoidance strategy to avoid the dogs. Also humans are known to eat the hyrax.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>The southern tree hyrax is a herbivore. It consumes many different parts of the plants such as the leaves, petioles, twigs, shoots, fleshy fruit, and hard seeds. Individual species are too many to list, but <i>Hagenia abyssinica</i>, <i>Hypericum revolutum</i>, and <i>Podocarpus falcatus</i> are the most common.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction.2FLife_Cycle">Reproduction/Life Cycle</span></h2>
<p>Milner and Harris reported that they were unable to determine the mating system but speculated that it may be facultative monogamy/polygyny. After a gestation period of 7 months, 1-2 young are born. At birth they are well developed and they weigh approximately 380 g (13.4 oz.). The southern tree hyrax reaches maturity at about 12 months old.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The previously recognized <i>Dendrohyrax validus</i> True, 1890 (Schlitter, In Wilson and Reeder 1993), called the mountain forest tree hyrax, is included in <i>Dendrohyrax arboreus</i> until detailed taxonomic research is conducted (Shoshani, In Wilson and Reeder 2005).</p>
