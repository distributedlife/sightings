<p>The <b>southern fin whale</b> (<i>Balaenoptera physalus quoyi</i>) is a <span>subspecies</span> of <span>fin whale</span> that lives in the <span>Southern Ocean</span>. At least one other subspecies of fin whale, the <span>northern fin whale</span> (<i>B. p. physalus</i>), exists in the <span>northern hemisphere</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Based on differences in the vertebrae, the <span>Swedish</span> <span>zoologist</span> <span>Einar L&#xF6;nnberg</span> (1931) designated <i>Balaenoptera physalus quoyii</i> (later the <span>Russian</span> scientist A.G. Tomilin (1957) corrected this to <i>B. p. quoyi</i>). <i>B. p. quoyi</i> in turn is based on <i>Balaena quoyi</i> (Fischer, 1829), which was the name given to a 16.7 m (55 ft) specimen seen on the shores of the Falkland Islands by Monsieur Quoy and originally named <i>Balaena rostrata australis</i> by Desmoulins (1822).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Size">Size</span></h2>
<p>Southern fin whales are larger than their northern hemisphere counterparts, with males averaging 20.5 m (67 ft) and females 22 m (72 ft). Maximum reported figures are 25 m (82 ft) for males and 27.3 m (89.5 ft) for females, while the longest measured by Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929) were 22.4 m (73' 7" ft) and 24.5 m (80' 5" ft); although Major F. A. Spencer, while whaling inspector of the factory ship <i>Southern Princess</i> (1936-38), confirmed the length of a 25.9 m (85 ft) female caught in the Antarctic south of the southern Indian Ocean. At sexual maturity, males average 19.2 m (63 ft) and females 19.9 m (65.3 ft).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>Because of the opposing seasons in each hemisphere, <i>B. p. quoyi</i> breeds at a different time of the year than <i>B. p. physalus</i>. Peak conception for <i>B. p. quoyi</i> is June-July, while peak birthing is in May.</p>
