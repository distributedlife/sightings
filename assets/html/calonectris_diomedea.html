<p>The <b>Cory's shearwater</b> (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) is a large <span>shearwater</span> in the <span>seabird</span> family <span>Procellariidae</span>.</p>
<p>This species breeds on islands and cliffs in the <span>Mediterranean</span> and North Atlantic (mostly among the <span>Azores</span> islands), with the odd outpost on the <span>Atlantic</span> coast of <span>Iberia</span>. They nest on open ground or among rocks or less often in a <span>burrow</span> where one white egg is laid. The burrow is visited at night to minimise predation from large <span>gulls</span>. In late summer and autumn, most birds <span>migrate</span> into the Atlantic as far north as the south-western coasts of <span>Great Britain</span> and <span>Ireland</span>. They return to the Mediterranean in February. The biggest colony is located in <span>Savage Islands</span>, <span>Madeira</span>.</p>
<p>This bird flies with long glides, and always with wings bowed and angled slightly back, unlike the stiff, straight-winged flight of the similarly sized <span>great shearwater</span>.</p>
<p>This shearwater is identifiable by its size, at 45&#x2013;56&#xA0;cm in length and with a 112&#x2013;126&#xA0;cm wingspan. It has brownish-grey upperparts, white underparts and a yellowish bill. It lacks the brown belly patch, dark shoulder markings and black cap of the great shearwater.</p>
<p>There are two subspecies, the <span>Mediterranean</span> subspecies <i>C. d. diomedea</i>, and the <span>Atlantic</span> subspecies <i>C. d. borealis</i>. They are similar in appearance, although the Atlantic race is larger with a stouter bill. They are best distinguished by the pattern of the underwing. Being fairly distinct (Heidrich <i>et al.</i> 1998), they are sometimes regarded as separate species, <i>C. d. diomedea</i> then being named Scopoli's shearwater.</p>
<p>Cory's shearwater feeds on <span>fish</span>, <span>molluscs</span> and offal, and can dive deep (50 feet/15 metres or more) in search of prey. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles. This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from ships or appropriate headlands. The <span>Bay of Biscay</span> ferries are particularly good for this species. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.</p>
<p>This bird was named after the American ornithologist <span>Charles B. Cory</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>Cape Verde shearwater</span> <i>C. edwardsii</i> (<span>Oustalet</span>, 1883) was once considered a subspecies of Cory's shearwater but has recently been split off as a separate species (Snow &amp; Perrins 1998). It is <span>endemic</span> to the <span>Cape Verde Islands</span>. It has an all dark, slim bill, and darker head and upperparts than Cory's. The flight has been described as rather more typically shearwater-like than the Cory's, with stiffer and more rapid wing beats.</p>
