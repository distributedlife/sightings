<p>The <b>pin-tailed snipe</b> (<i>Gallinago stenura</i>) also known as the <b>pintail snipe</b>, is a small stocky <span>wader</span>. It breeds in northern <span>Russia</span> and <span>migrates</span> to spend the non-breeding season in southern <span>Asia</span> from <span>Pakistan</span> to <span>Indonesia</span>. It is the most common migrant <span>snipe</span> in southern <span>India</span>, <span>Sri Lanka</span> and much of <span>Southeast Asia</span>. It is a vagrant to north-western and northern <span>Australia</span>, and to East Africa <span>Kenya</span>.</p>
<p>Its breeding habitat is damp marshes and tundra in <span>Arctic</span> and boreal <span>Russia</span>. Birds in their non-breeding range use a variety of wetlands, often with <span>common snipe</span>, but may be found also in drier habitats than their relative. They nest in a well-hidden location on the ground.</p>
<p>These birds forage in mud or soft soil, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, but also some plant material.</p>
<p>This 25&#x2013;27&#xA0;cm long bird is similar to the longer-billed and longer-tailed common snipe. Adults have short greenish-grey legs and a long straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown on top, with cream lines down their back. They are pale underneath with a streaked buff breast and white belly. They have a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. Sexes are similar, and immatures differ only in minor plumage details.</p>
<p>The wings are less pointed than common snipe, and lack the white trailing edge of that species. The shorter tail and flatter flight path when flushed also made flight separation from Common relatively easy.</p>
<p>Male pin-tailed snipes often display in a group, with a loud repetitive <i>tcheka</i> song which has a crescendo of fizzing and buzzing sounds, and also <span>whistling noises produced in flight</span> by the pin-like outer tail feathers which give this species its <span>English</span> name. The normal call is a weak <i>squik</i>.</p>
