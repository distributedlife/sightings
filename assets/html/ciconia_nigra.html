<p>The <b>black stork</b> (<i>Ciconia nigra</i>) is a large wading bird in the <span>stork</span> family Ciconiidae. It is a widespread, but uncommon, species that breeds in the warmer parts of Europe (predominantly in central and eastern regions), across temperate Asia and Southern Africa. This is a shy and wary species, unlike the closely related <span>white stork</span>. It is seen in pairs or small flocks&#x2014;in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. The black stork feeds on <span>amphibians</span> and <span>insects</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_etymology">Taxonomy and etymology</span></h2>
<p>The stork family contains several genera in three major groups: the open-billed and wood storks (<i><span>Mycteria</span></i> and <i><span>Anastomus</span></i>), the giant storks (<i><span>Ephippiorhynchus</span></i>, <i><span>Jabiru</span></i> and <i><span>Leptoptilos</span></i>), and the "typical storks", <i><span>Ciconia</span></i>. The typical storks include the white stork and six other <span>extant</span> species, which are characterised by straight bills and mainly black and white plumage. Within the genus <i>Ciconia</i>, the black stork's closest relatives are the other European species, the <span>white stork</span> and its former subspecies, the black-billed <span>Oriental white stork</span> of east Asia. The black stork was found to be <span>basal</span> in analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997. Fossil remains have been recovered from <span>Miocene</span> beds <span>Rusinga</span> and <span>Maboko Islands</span> in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.</p>
<p>The black stork was one of the many <span>species originally described</span> by <span>Linnaeus</span> in the landmark 1758 <span>10th edition</span> of his <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i>, where it was given the binomial name of <i>Ardea nigra</i>. It was moved to the new <span>genus</span> <i><span>Ciconia</span></i> by French <span>zoologist</span> <span>Mathurin Jacques Brisson</span> two years later. Both the genus and the <span>specific names</span> are <span>Latin</span>; <i>Ciconia</i> is "stork" and <i>nigra</i> is "black". The word <i>stork</i> is derived from the <span>Old English</span> word <i>storc</i>, thought to be related to the <span>Old High German</span> <i>storah</i>, meaning "stork", and the Old English <i>stearc</i>, meaning "stiff".</p>

Adult in a Dutch zoo</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Slightly smaller than the white stork, the black stork is a large bird, 95 to 100&#xA0;cm (37&#x2013;39&#xA0;in) in length with a 145&#x2013;155&#xA0;cm (5&#xA0;ft) wingspan, and weighing around 3 kilograms (6.6&#xA0;lb). They can stand as tall as 102&#xA0;cm (40&#xA0;in). Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck, and a long, straight, pointed beak. The plumage is all black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The bare skin around its eyes is red, as are its red bill and legs. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average.</p>
<p>The juvenile resembles the adult in plumage pattern, but the areas corresponding to the adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill, and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It may be confused with the juvenile <span>yellow-billed stork</span>, but the latter has a paler wings and mantle, longer bill, and white under the wings.</p>
<p>It walks slowly and steadily on the ground. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched. It has a rasping call, but rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>During the summer, the black stork is found from Eastern Asia (<span>Siberia</span> and China) west to <span>Central Europe</span>, reaching <span>Estonia</span> in the north, <span>Poland</span>, <span>Lower Saxony</span> and <span>Bavaria</span> in <span>Germany</span>, <span>Czech Republic</span>, <span>Hungary</span>, and <span>Greece</span> in the south, with an outlying population in <span>Spain</span> and <span>Portugal</span>. They are nowhere abundant in these western parts of their distribution, but more densely inhabit the eastern <span>Transcaucasus</span>. A population of black storks is also resident in Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Preferring more wooded areas than the better known white stork, the black stork breeds in large marshy wetlands with interspersed <span>coniferous</span> or broadleaved <span>woodlands</span>, but also inhabits <span>hills</span> and <span>mountains</span> with sufficient network of <span>creeks</span>. It does inhabit more areas in the Caspian lowlands.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>
<p>The black stork is a strong <span>migrant</span>, wintering in tropical <span>Africa</span> and <span>India</span>. A broad-winged soaring bird, the black stork is assisted by thermals of hot air for long distance flight, although are less dependent on them than the white stork. Since thermals only form over land, storks, together with large <span>raptors</span>, must cross the <span>Mediterranean</span> at the narrowest points, and many black storks can be seen going through the <span>Bosporus</span>. They fly approximately 100 to 250&#xA0;km a day with daily maxima up to 500&#xA0;km.</p>

<p>The storks migrate from the middle of August to the end of September. They return in the middle of March. About 10 percent of the western storks choose the passage <span>Sicily</span> - <span>Cap Bon</span>, <span>Tunisia</span>. The common route goes over <span>Gibraltar</span>. Many birds are fly around the <span>Sahara</span> next to the coast. Most birds are wintering in the wetlands of <span>Nigeria</span> or <span>Mali</span>. The eastern birds take the route <span>Bosphorus</span>-<span>Sinai</span>-<span>Nile</span> to Africa. Birds that summer in <span>Siberia</span> winter in northern and northeastern <span>India</span>. In Southern Africa, black storks that nest in the central montane areas perform season winter movements to warmer coastal and subtropical zones.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>The black stork builds a stick nest high in trees or on cliffs. It nests in Central Europe in April to May, and is a winter visitor to northern India, Nepal east to Myanmar.</p>
<p>Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their young, generally the smallest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. Despite this, this behaviour has not commonly been observed.</p>
