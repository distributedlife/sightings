<p>The <b>Balearic shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus mauretanicus</i>) is a medium-sized <span>shearwater</span> in the <span>seabird</span> family <i>Procellariidae</i>. It was long regarded a <span>subspecies</span> of the <span>Manx shearwater</span> (see there for more on the <i>Puffinus puffinus</i> <span>superspecies</span>); following an initial split it was held to be a subspecies of the "Mediterranean shearwater" (Sibley &amp; Monroe 1990) for nearly ten more years, until it was resolved to be a distinct <span>species</span>, separate from the <span>yelkouan shearwater</span> (Wink <i>et al.</i> 1993, Heidrich <i>et al.</i> 1998, Sangster <i>et al.</i> 2002). It is the last <span>taxon</span> of the <i>puffinus</i> complex that was recognized as a separate entity.</p>
<p>It appears to belong to a group of Mediterranean and adjacent <span>Atlantic</span> species which includes the <span>yelkouan shearwater</span> (Austin 1996) and one to three <span>prehistorically</span> <span>extinct</span> taxa, <span>Hole's</span> and possibly also <span>Olson's shearwater</span> and an undescribed form of unclear distinctness from <span>Menorca</span> (Alcover 2001). Hole's shearwater may be the closest known relative of <i>P. mauretanicus</i>. The two living Mediterranean lineages had probably separated before the end of the <span>Pliocene</span> (c. 2 <span>mya</span>), as indicated by molecular differences and the <span>Ibizan</span> fossil <i><span>Puffinus nestori</span></i> from the Late Pliocene or Early <span>Pleistocene</span>, which may have been the direct ancestor of the present species (Heidrich <i>et al.</i> 1998).</p>
<p>This species breeds on islands and coastal cliffs in the <span>Balearic islands</span>. Most winter in that sea, but some <span>enter</span> the Atlantic in late summer, reaching north to <span>Great Britain</span> and <span>Ireland</span>.</p>
<p>This species nests in <span>burrows</span> which are visited only at night to avoid predation by large <span>gulls</span>.</p>
<p>This bird is approximately 33&#xA0;cm long, with an 85&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm wingspan. It has the typically "shearing" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from dark brown to dirty white as the dark upperparts and paler undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.</p>
<p>Apart from the less contrasted <span>plumage</span>, this species is very similar to the <span>Atlantic</span> Manx shearwater and the yelkouan shearwater found elsewhere in the <span>Mediterranean</span>. There exists at least one mixed breeding colony of Balearic and yelkouan shearwaters, on <span>Minorca</span>, and the species' winter ranges overlap in the Central Mediterranean; for scientific purposes at least, a combination of <span>morphological</span> characteristics and <span>DNA sequence</span> data is suggested to identify the species (Genovart <i>et al.</i> 2005).</p>
<p>It is under severe threat from the development of holiday resorts near its breeding sites, and also from animals such as <span>cats</span> and <span>rats</span>. The discovery of yelkouan shearwaters in the Minorcan colony suggests that <span>hybridization</span> may also pose a problem (Genovart <i>et al.</i> 2005); the Balearic shearwater is considered <span>critically endangered</span> with extinction by the <span>IUCN</span>. Recent models estimate a mean decrease of 7.4% per year and a mean extinction time of 40.4 years. This equates to an ongoing decline of more than 80% over the next three generations (54 years).</p>
<p>This is a gregarious species, which can been seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on in autumn.</p>
<p>It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls, higher pitched than the Manx shearwater's.</p>
<p>The Balearic shearwater feeds on <span>fish</span> and <span>molluscs</span>. It does not follow <span>boats</span>.</p>
