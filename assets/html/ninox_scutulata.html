<p>The <b>brown hawk-owl</b> (<i>Ninox scutulata</i>) is an <span>owl</span> which is a resident breeder in south Asia from <span>India</span> and <span>Sri Lanka</span> east to western <span>Indonesia</span> and south <span>China</span>.</p>
<p>This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as <span>typical owls</span>, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the <span>barn owls</span>, Tytonidae.</p>
<p>The brown hawk-owl is a resident breeder in most of tropical south <span>Asia</span> from the <span>Middle East</span> to south <span>China</span>. Its habitat is well-wooded country and forest. It lays three to five eggs in a tree hole.</p>
<p>The brown hawk-owl is a medium-sized (32&#xA0;cm) owl with a <span>hawk-like</span> shape due to its long tail and lack of a distinct facial disk. The upperparts are dark brown, with a barred tail. The underparts are whitish with reddish-brown streaking, although the <span>subspecies</span> found in the <span>Andaman Islands</span> has dark brown underparts. The tail is barred. The eyes are large and yellow. Sexes are similar.</p>
<p>This species is very nocturnal but it can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. It feeds mainly on large insects, frogs, lizards, small birds, and mice. The call is a repeated low soft, musical <i>oo-uk ...ooo-uk...</i> which may be heard at dusk and dawn.</p>
<p>There is only one record of the brown hawk-owl in the western hemisphere, an individual photographed on <span>St. Paul Island, Alaska</span>, on August 27, 2007.</p>
