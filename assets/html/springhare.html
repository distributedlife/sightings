<p><i><b>Pedetes</b></i> is a <span>genus</span> of <span>rodent</span>, the <b>springhares</b>, in the family <span>Pedetidae</span>. Members of the genus are distributed across southern and Eastern Africa.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Species">Species</span></h2>
<p>A number of species both extant and extinct are classified in the genus <i>Pedetes</i>. They include:</p>

<p>Throughout the 20th century, the living species (and occasionally the prehistoric one) were merged into <i>P. capensis</i>, making the genus <span>monotypic</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>These rodents are generally <span>nocturnal</span> and sleep through the day in burrows they dig. They feed on foliage, roots and other vegetable matter, and occasionally <span>arthropods</span>. Outside the burrow they usually move around by hopping on their hind legs.</p>
<p>When only one springhare species was recognized, it was listed as vulnerable by the <span>IUCN</span> in 1996 due to an approximately 20% decrease in the population over the previous ten years. This has been caused by intense hunting and the loss of habitat. However, the negative trend has not persisted, and both species are now listed as Species of Least Concern.</p>
