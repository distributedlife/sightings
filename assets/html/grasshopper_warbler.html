<p>The <b>grass warblers</b> are small <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> belonging to the <span>genus</span> <i><b>Locustella</b></i>. Formerly placed in the <span>paraphyletic</span> "<span>Old World warbler</span>" assemblage, they are now considered the northernmost representatives of a largely <span>Gondwanan</span> family, the <span>Locustellidae</span>.</p>
<p>These are rather drab brownish "warblers" usually associated with fairly open grassland, shrubs or marshes. Some are streaked, others plain, all are difficult to view. They are <span>insectivorous</span>.</p>
<p>The most characteristic feature of this group is that the song of several species is a mechanical <span>insect</span>-like reeling which gives rise to the group's scientific name.</p>
<p>Species breeding in temperate regions are strongly <span>migratory</span>.</p>
<p>The species are:</p>

<p>A <span>fossil</span> <span>acrocoracoid</span> from the <span>Late Miocene</span> (about 11 mya) of <span>Rudab&#xE1;nya</span> (NE <span>Hungary</span>) is quite similar to this bone in the present genus (Bernor <i>et al.</i> 2002). Given its rather early age (most <span>Passerida</span> genera are not known until the <span>Pliocene</span>), it is not too certain that it is correctly placed here, but it is highly likely to belong to the Locustellidae, or the <span>Sylvioidea</span> at the least. As the grass warblers are the only known locustellid warblers from Europe, it is still fairly likely that the bone piece belongs to a <span>basal</span> <i>Locustella</i>.</p>
