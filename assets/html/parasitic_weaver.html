<p>The <b>Cuckoo-finch</b> (<i>Anomalospiza imberbis</i>), also known as the <b>Parasitic Weaver</b> or <b>Cuckoo Weaver</b>, is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> now placed in the family <span>Viduidae</span> with the indigobirds and whydahs. It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a small finch-like bird, about 11&#x2013;13&#xA0;cm long. It has a short tail, large legs and feet, and a large, deep, conical <span>bill</span>. The adult male has a black bill and a yellow head and underparts. The upperparts are olive-green with black streaks. The yellow areas become increasingly bright prior to the breeding season as the feathers become worn. The adult female is buff with heavy black streaking above and light streaks on the flanks; its face is largely plain buff and the throat is buff-white.</p>
<p>It has various chattering calls. Displaying males have a nasal <span>song</span>.</p>

Trapped bird at <span>Polokwane</span>, Limpopo</div>

<p>The species was described in 1868 by the German ornithologist <span>Jean Cabanis</span> based on a specimen from <span>East Africa</span>, probably from the coast opposite <span>Zanzibar</span>. It was initially placed in the genus <i><span>Crithagra</span></i> but later moved to a genus of its own <i>Anomalospiza</i>. The name of the genus means "anomalous finch" with <i>spiza</i> being a <span>Greek</span> word for finch. The specific name <i>imberbis</i> comes from <span>Latin</span> and means "beardless".</p>
<p>Its closest relatives are thought to be the indigobirds and whydahs of the genus <i><span>Vidua</span></i>. These birds are now usually considered to form a family, Viduidae. Previously they were treated as a subfamily, Viduinae, within either the <span>estrildid finch</span> family, Estrildidae, or the <span>weaver</span> family, Ploceidae.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It has a scattered distribution across sub-Saharan Africa where it occurs in open or lightly wooded grassland, especially near damp areas.</p>
<p>In West Africa, it occurs in <span>Guinea</span>, <span>Sierra Leone</span>, the <span>Ivory Coast</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Togo</span>, <span>Benin</span>, eastern <span>Nigeria</span> and north-west <span>Cameroon</span> with vagrant records from the <span>Gambia</span> and <span>Mali</span>. Further east it is found in southern <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Burundi</span>, southern and eastern parts of the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> and locally in the <span>Republic of the Congo</span>. In southern Africa, it occurs in <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, southern and eastern <span>Angola</span>, north-east <span>Namibia</span>, northern and eastern <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, eastern <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>.</p>
<p>It has a large range and an apparently stable population and so is classified as <span>Least Concern</span> by <span>BirdLife International</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It typically occurs in pairs or small flocks during the breeding season and larger flocks outside the breeding season. It forages on the ground or perched on the flower heads of grasses or herbs. It feeds mainly on grass seeds.</p>
<p>It is a <span>brood parasite</span>, laying its <span>eggs</span> in the <span>nests</span> of <span>cisticolas</span> and <span>prinias</span>. The eggs are white, pale blue or pink with brown, reddish or violet markings. They are 17&#x2013;17.3&#xA0;mm long and 12.5&#x2013;13&#xA0;mm wide. The eggs are incubated for 14 days. The young bird <span>fledges</span> after 18 days and remains dependent on its hosts for another 10&#x2013;40 days. The young of the host bird usually disappear although there have been records of the host's nestlings surviving alongside the young Cuckoo-finch. Sometimes two Cuckoo-finch chicks have been found in the same nest.</p>
