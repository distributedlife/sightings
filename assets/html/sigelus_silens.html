<p>The <b>fiscal flycatcher</b> (<i>Sigelus silens</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> <span>family</span>. It is a resident breeder in <span>Botswana</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Mozambique</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>, and a <span>vagrant</span> to <span>Namibia</span>. It is the <span>only member</span> of the genus <i>Sigelus</i>.</p>
<p>This species is found in subtropical open <span>woodland</span>, dry <span>savanna</span>, <span>shrubland</span> and <span>suburban</span> gardens.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This black and white bird gets its name from its resemblance to the <span>northern fiscal</span>, a <span>shrike</span>.</p>
<p>The fiscal flycatcher is 17&#x2013;20&#xA0;cm in length. The adult male is black above and white below with white wing patches and white sides to the tail. The female is brown, not black, above. The juvenile is like the female but duller and with brown spots and scalloping above and below.</p>
<p>The <span>song</span> is a weak chittering, and the alarm call is <i>tssisk</i>.</p>
<p>The male can be confused with the northern fiscal, but the shrike has a heavy hooked <span>bill</span>, a white patch on the shoulder rather than the lower wing, and has no white on its longer tail.</p>
<p>The fiscal flycatcher is larger than the male <span>collared flycatcher</span>, which has a white collar and lacks white wing panels.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The fiscal flycatcher builds an open cup nest from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in a dense bush.</p>
<p>The fiscal flycatcher feeds on insects, often taken in flight.</p>
