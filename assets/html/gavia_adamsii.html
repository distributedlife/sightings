<p>The <b>yellow-billed loon</b> (<i>Gavia adamsii</i>), also known as the <b>white-billed diver</b>, is the largest member of the <span>loon</span> or diver family. Breeding adults have a black head, white underparts and chequered black-and-white mantle. Non-breeding <span>plumage</span> is drabber with the chin and foreneck white. The main distinguishing feature from great northern loon is the longer straw-yellow bill which, because the <span>culmen</span> is straight, appears slightly uptilted.</p>
<p>It breeds in the <span>Arctic</span> and winters mainly at sea along the <span>coasts</span> of the northern <span>Pacific Ocean</span> and northwestern <span>Norway</span>; it also sometimes overwinters on large inland lakes. It occasionally strays well south of its normal wintering range, and has been recorded as a vagrant in more than 22 countries. This <span>species</span>, like all divers, is a specialist <span>fish</span>-eater, catching its <span>prey</span> underwater. Its call is an eerie wailing, lower pitched than great northern diver.</p>

<p>First described by English zoologist <span>George Robert Gray</span> in 1859 based on a specimen collected in Alaska, the yellow-billed loon is a <span>monotypic</span> species, with no subspecies despite its large <span>Holarctic</span> range. It is closely related to the <span>great northern loon</span>, which it strongly resembles in plumage and behaviour; some taxonomists consider the two species to be <span>allopatric</span> forms of the same <span>superspecies</span>. Both are thought to have evolved from a population of <span>black-throated loons</span> which colonized the <span>Nearctic</span> and were subsequently cut off from other populations.</p>
<p>The genus name <i>Gavia</i> comes from the <span>Latin</span> for "sea mew", as used by ancient Roman naturalist <span>Pliny the Elder</span>. The <span>specific epithet</span> <i>adamsii</i> honours <span>Edward Adams</span>, a British naval surgeon and naturalist who sketched and collected numerous species, including this one, on several trips to the <span>Arctic</span>. The word "loon" is thought to have derived from the Swedish <i>lom</i>, the Old Norse or Icelandic <i>l&#xF3;mr</i>, or the Old Dutch <i>loen</i>, all of which mean "lame" or "clumsy", and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land. "Diver" refers to the family's underwater method of hunting for prey, while "yellow-billed" and "white-billed" are references to the bird's distinctively pale <span>bill</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>With a length of 76 to 97&#xA0;cm (30 to 38&#xA0;in), a wingspan of 135 to 160&#xA0;cm (53 to 63&#xA0;in), and a weight ranging from 4 to 6.4&#xA0;kg (8.8 to 14.1&#xA0;lb), the yellow-billed loon is the largest member of the loon (diver) family.  The adult is primarily black and white in breeding <span>plumage</span>, with a purple gloss on its head and neck.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_range">Habitat and range</span></h2>
<p>The yellow-billed loon is an Arctic species, breeding primarily along the coasts of the Arctic Ocean as far north as 78&#xB0; N and wintering on sheltered coastal waters of the northern <span>Pacific Ocean</span> and the northwestern coast of <span>Norway</span>. It has been recorded as a breeding bird in <span>Russia</span>, Canada and the United States. Though it winters primarily to the north of 50&#xB0; N, its winter range extends south to 35&#xB0; N off the coast of Japan, and it has been recorded as a vagrant in more than 20 countries, including some as far south as <span>Mexico</span> and <span>Spain</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Though it prefers freshwater pools or lakes in the tundra, the yellow-billed loon will also breed along rivers, estuaries or the coast in low-lying areas of the Arctic; in general, it avoids forested areas. Breeding typically starts in early June, though it is dependent on the timing of the spring thaw. Like all members of its family, the yellow-billed loon builds a <span>nest</span> of plant material very close to the edge of the water. The female lays two <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The yellow-billed loon is a specialist fish eater, though it also takes <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>molluscs</span> and <span>annelids</span>. It dives in pursuit of prey, which is caught underwater.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_and_threats">Conservation and threats</span></h2>
<p>In 2010, the <span>IUCN</span> (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) changed the status of the yellow-billed loon from <span>Least Concern</span> to <span>Near Threatened</span>, as the species appears to be in a "moderately rapid" population decline. An unsustainable level of subsistence harvesting by <span>indigenous peoples</span> was specifically named as the main threat.</p>
<p>The yellow-billed loon is one of the <span>species</span> to which the <i><span>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</span></i> (AEWA) applies; in the <span>Americas</span>, it is protected by the <span>Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</span>.</p>
