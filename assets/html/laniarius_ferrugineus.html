<p>The <b>Southern Boubou</b> (<i>Laniarius ferrugineus</i>)('ferrugineus' - rust-coloured) is a <span>bushshrike</span>. Though these <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> and their relations were once included with true <span>shrikes</span> in the <span>Laniidae</span>, they are not closely related to that family.</p>
<p>This species is found in southeastern <span>Africa</span>, mainly in southeastern <span>Zimbabwe</span>, eastern <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Mozambique</span> and southern and eastern <span>South Africa</span>. It frequents dense thickets in forests, <span>mangroves</span>, scrub and gardens. In drier regions, it is found in riverside woodland.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The male Southern Boubou is a fairly distinctive 20&#x2013;22&#xA0;cm long bird with black upperparts extending from the top of the head down to the tail, a striking white wing stripe, and a relatively long black tail with white outer feathers. The underparts are white shading to rufous on the lower belly, undertail and flanks. The bill, eyes and legs are black.</p>
<p>The female is similar to the male, but dark grey above and with a rufous wash to the breast. Young birds are like the female, but mottled buff-brown above, have a buff wash to the wing bar, and are barred below.</p>
<p>The rufous on the underparts, which gives this species its scientific name, distinguishes it from the <span>Tropical</span> and <span>Swamp Boubous</span>. It superficially resembles the <span>Southern Fiscal</span>, <i>Lanius collaris</i>, but is shorter tailed, has more white in the wing, and is much less conspicuous in its habits.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Unlike the true shrikes, which perch conspicuously in the open, the Southern Boubou prefers to forage in dense vegetation close to the ground, a habit which has led to its being called shy and <span>skulking</span>. The food is mainly <span>insects</span>, taken from the ground or picked off vegetation as the bird creeps low in bushes. It will also take small rodents, lizards <span>snails</span> and fruits.</p>
<p>The Southern Boubou has a duetted call, with a <i>ooo-whee-ooo</i>, followed by a whistled <i>ooo-ooo-wheee</i> or <i>wheee-wheee</i> followed by <i>ooo-whee-ooo</i>. The duet has many variations and the liquid <i>ooo-whee-ooo</i> call may be mistaken for that of a <span>Black-headed Oriole</span>. Its alarm call is a muted <i>cluck</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The nest, built mainly by the female, is a shallow cup in a creeper or dense bush into which the usually two brown-blotched greenish-white <span>eggs</span> are laid. Both sexes incubate for 16&#x2013;17 days to hatching, and both bring food to the chicks. Fledging takes place in about another 16 days. About 2% of nests are <span>parasitised</span> by the <span>Black Cuckoo</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Races">Races</span></h2>
<p>There are six races, differing in size, upperpart colour, the extent of rufous on the underparts, and the degree of <span>sexual dimorphism</span>.</p>
