<p>The <b>Taita Fiscal</b> or <b>Teita Fiscal</b> (<i>Lanius dorsalis</i>) is a member of the <span>shrike</span> family found in east <span>Africa</span> from southeastern <span>Sudan</span>, southern <span>Ethiopia</span>, and western <span>Somalia</span> to northeastern <span>Tanzania</span>. Its habitat is dry open thornbush and <span>acacia</span> and other dry open woodland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This is a fairly distinctive 21-cm-long <span>passerine</span> with white underparts and a black crown, hindneck and wings. The back is grey with a characteristic white 'V' and the rump is white. The tail is relatively long and black with white outer feathers. There is a small white patch on the wings. The bill, eyes and legs are black. The adult male and female Taita Fiscal have similar plumage except for a rufous lower flank of the female which is usually hidden by the wing.</p>
<p>The juvenile is mainly brown&#x2013;black above, with barring on the head and buff tips to the shoulder feathers. Its underparts are whitish with darker barring.</p>
<p>The adult Taita Fiscal is distinguished from other black-headed fiscals by the grey back and the wing pattern, if those are well seen.</p>
<p>It gives a jumbled mix of shrike-like whistles and buzzes, including a <i>chwaa-pikerrek-chrrrr-yook pikechik</i> song.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits">Habits</span></h2>
<p>The Taita Fiscal is usually solitary and hunts <span>insects</span> and small <span>vertebrates</span> from an exposed perch or the tops of shrubs.</p>
<p>The nest is a twig and grass cup built in a thorn tree. Three or four white eggs blotched with grey or white is the typical clutch.</p>
