<p>The <b>Eurasian wigeon</b>, also known as <b>widgeon</b> or <b>Eurasian widgeon</b> (<i>Anas penelope</i>, previously <i>Mareca penelope</i>) is one of three species of <span>wigeon</span> in the <span>dabbling duck</span> <span>genus</span> <i>Anas</i>. It is common and widespread within its range. This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 under its current scientific name.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This <span>dabbling duck</span> is 42&#x2013;52&#xA0;cm (17&#x2013;20&#xA0;in) long with a 71&#x2013;80&#xA0;cm (28&#x2013;31&#xA0;in) wingspan, and a weight of 500&#x2013;1,073&#xA0;g (1.102&#x2013;2.366&#xA0;lb). The breeding male has grey flanks and back, with a black rear end and a dark green <span>speculum</span> and a brilliant white patch on upper wings, obvious in flight or at rest. It has a pink breast, white belly, and a chestnut head with a creamy <span>crown</span>. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female. The female is light brown, with <span>plumage</span> much like a female <span>American wigeon</span>. It can be distinguished from most other ducks, apart from American wigeon, on shape. However, that species has a paler head and white axillaries on its underwing. The female can be a rufous <span>morph</span> with a redder head, and a gray morph with a more gray head.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>It breeds in the northernmost areas of <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>. It is the Old World counterpart of <span>North America</span>'s <span>American wigeon</span>. It is strongly <span>migratory</span> and winters further south than its breeding range. It migrates to southern <span>Asia</span> and <span>Africa</span>. In <span>Great Britain</span> and <span>Ireland</span>, the Eurasian wigeon is common as a winter visitor, but scarce as a breeding bird in <span>Scotland</span>, the <span>Lake District</span>, the <span>Pennines</span> and occasionally further south, with only a handful of breeding pairs in <span>Ireland</span>. It can be found as an uncommon winter visitor in the <span>United States</span> on the <span>mid-Atlantic</span> and <span>Pacific</span> coasts. It is a rare visitor to the rest of the <span>United States</span> except for the <span>Four Corners</span> and the southern <span>Appalachians</span>.</p>

<p>The Eurasian wigeon is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some taller vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which it does very readily. It nests on the ground, near water and under cover. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks. They will join with flocks of the <span>American wigeon</span> in the <span>United States</span>, and they also hybridize with them. This is a noisy species. The male has a clear whistle that sounds like: "pjiew pjiew", whereas the female has a low growl&#xA0;: "rawr".</p>
<p>The Eurasian wigeon is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. Its conservation status is <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
