<p>The <b>Eurasian teal</b> or <b>common teal</b> (<i>Anas crecca</i>) is a common and widespread <span>duck</span> which breeds in <span>temperate</span> <span>Eurasia</span> and <span>migrates</span> south in winter. The Eurasian teal is often called simply the <b>teal</b> due to being the only one of these small <span>dabbling ducks</span> in much of its range. The bird gives its name to the blue-green colour <span>teal</span>.</p>
<p>It is a highly gregarious duck outside the breeding season and can form large flocks. It is commonly found in sheltered wetlands and feeds on seeds and aquatic invertebrates. The <span>North American</span> <span>green-winged teal</span> (<i>A.&#xA0;carolinensis</i>) was formerly (and sometimes is still) considered a <span>subspecies</span> of <i>A.&#xA0;crecca</i>.</p>

Note typical wide white wing stripe and conspicuous face markings of male.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Eurasian teal is the smallest extant <span>dabbling duck</span> at 20&#x2013;30&#xA0;cm (13&#x2013;17&#xA0;in) length and with an average weight of 340 g (13&#xA0;oz) in drake (males) and 320 g (12&#xA0;oz) in hens (females). The wings are 17.5&#x2013;20.4&#xA0;cm (6.9&#x2013;8.0&#xA0;in) long, yielding a wingspan of 53&#x2013;59&#xA0;cm (21&#x2013;23&#xA0;in). The bill measures 3.2&#x2013;4&#xA0;cm (1.3&#x2013;1.6&#xA0;in) in length, and the <span>tarsus</span> 2.8&#x2013;3.4&#xA0;cm (1.1&#x2013;1.3&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>From a distance, the drakes in <span>nuptial plumage</span> appear grey, with a dark head, a yellowish behind, and a white stripe running along the flanks. Their head and upper neck is <span>chestnut</span>, with a wide and iridescent dark green patch of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowsh-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch's forward end, curving along the base of the bill. The breast is <span>buff</span> with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, and the rest of the body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish <span>vermiculations</span>, appearing medium grey even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary <span>remiges</span> are dark greyish brown; the <span>speculum feathers</span> are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the speculum together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge. The tail and tail coverts are black, with a bright yellowish-buff triangular patch in the center of the coverts at each side.</p>

Drake in <span>eclipse plumage</span> (rightmost bird), hen and young</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, somewhat darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks on the head and neck, and scaly spots on the rest of the body; overall they look much like a tiny <span>mallard</span> (<i>A. platyrhynchos</i>) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's <span>rectrices</span> have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.</p>
<p>Immatures are coloured much like hens, but have a stronger pattern. The <span>downy</span> young are coloured like in other dabbling ducks: brown above and yellow below, with a yellow <span>supercilium</span>. They are recognizable by their tiny size however, weighing just 15&#xA0;grams (about half an ounce) at hatching.</p>
<p>The drake's bill is dark grey, in eclipse plumage often with some light greenish or brownish hue at the base. The bill of hens and immatures is pinkish or yellowish at the base, becoming dark grey towards the tip; the grey expands basewards as the birds age. The feet are dark grey in males and greyish <span>olive</span> or greyish-brown in females and immatures. The <span>iris</span> is always brown.</p>
<p>This is a noisy species. The male whistles <i>cryc</i> or <i>creelycc</i>, not loud but very clear and far-carrying. The female has a feeble <i>keh</i> or <i>neeh</i> <span>quack</span>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Males in nuptial plumage are distinguished from <span>green-winged teals</span> by the horizontal white scapular stripe, the lack of a <span>vertical</span> white bar at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light outlines of the face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in eclipse plumage, females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are hard to tell apart from the green-winged teal however.</p>

Eurasian teal ( <i>A. crecca</i>), drake in nuptial plumage (note horizontal white stripe from shoulder)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Eurasian teal belongs to the "true" teals, a group of small <i><span>Anas</span></i> dabbling ducks closely related to the <span>mallard</span> (<i>A. platyrhynchos</i>) and its relatives; that latter group in fact seems to have <span>evolved</span> from a true teal. It forms a <span>superspecies</span> with the <span>green-winged teal</span> and the <span>speckled teal</span> (<i>A. flavirostris</i>). A proposed <span>subspecies</span>, <i>A. c. nimia</i> of the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>, differs only in slightly larger size; it is probably not distinct.</p>

<p>Whether the Eurasian and green-winged teals are to be treated as one or two species is still being reviewed by the <span>AOU</span>, while the <span>IUCN</span> and <span>BirdLife International</span> separate them nowadays. Despite the almost identical and highly <span>apomorphic</span> <span>nuptial plumage</span> of their males, which continues to puzzle scientists, they seem well distinct species, as indicated by a wealth of behavioural, morphological and molecular data.</p>
<p>The Eurasian teal was first scientifically named by <span>Carl Linnaeus</span> in his 1758 edition of <i><span>Systema naturae</span></i>. His <span>Latin</span> description reads: <i>[Anas] macula alarum viridi, linea alba supra infraque oculos</i> &#x2013; "a duck with green speculum, a white line above and below the eyes" &#x2013; and his primary reference was the bird's description in his earlier work <i>Fauna Svecica</i>. In fact, the description he used in <i>Systema Naturae</i> was the name under which the bird went in the <i>Fauna Svecica</i>, demonstrating the value of his new <span>binomial nomenclature</span> by compressing the long-winded names formerly used in <span>biological classification</span> into much simpler <span>scientific names</span> like <i>Anas crecca</i>. Linnaeus also noted in his description that earlier authors had already written about the Eurasan teal at length: <span>Conrad Gessner</span> had described it in the <i><span>Historiae animalium</span></i> as the <i>anas parva</i> ("small duck") among his <i>querquedulae</i> ("teals"); <span>Ulisse Aldrovandi</span> had called it <i>phascade</i> or <i>querquedula minor</i> ("lesser teal"), and was duly referenced by <span>Francis Willughby</span> who named the species <i>querquedula secunda Aldrovandi</i> ("the second teal of Aldrovandus"). <span>John Ray</span> may be credited with formally introducing the name "common teal", while <span>Eleazar Albin</span> called it simply "the teal". As regards the <span>type locality</span> Linnaeus simply remarked that it inhabits <span>freshwater</span> ecosystems in <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>specific name</span> of Linnaeus is <span>onomatopoetic</span>, referring to the male's characteristic call which was already discussed by Linnaeus' sources. Thus, the scientific name of the Eurasian teal&#x2014;unchanged since Linnaeus' time&#x2014;translates as "duck that makes <i>cryc</i>"; common names like the <span>Bokm&#xE5;l</span> <i>krikkand</i>, <span>Danish</span> <i>krikand</i> and <span>German</span> <i>Krickente</i> mean the same.</p>

Wintering birds at <span>Purbasthali</span>, <span>Burdwan</span> District of <span>West Bengal</span> (<span>India</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Eurasian teal breeds across northern <span>Eurasia</span> and mostly winters well south of its breeding range. However, in the milder climate of <span>temperate</span> <span>Europe</span>, the summer and winter ranges overlap. For example, in the <span>United Kingdom</span> and <span>Ireland</span> a small summer population breeds, but far greater numbers of <span>Siberian</span> birds arrive in winter. In the <span>Caucasus</span> region, western <span>Asia Minor</span>, along the northern shores of the <span>Black Sea</span>, and even on the south coast of <span>Iceland</span> and on the <span>Vestmannaeyjar</span>, the species can be encountered all year, too.</p>
<p>In winter, there are high densities around the <span>Mediterranean</span>, including the entire <span>Iberian Peninsula</span> and extending west to <span>Mauretania</span>; on <span>Japan</span> and <span>Taiwan</span>; as well as in <span>South Asia</span>. Other important wintering locations include almost the entire length of the <span>Nile Valley</span>, the <span>Near East</span> and <span>Persian Gulf</span> region, the mountain ranges of northern <span>Iran</span>, and <span>South Korea</span> and continental <span>East</span> and <span>Southeast Asia</span>. More isolated wintering grounds are <span>Lake Victoria</span>, the <span>Senegal River</span> estuary, the swamps of the upper <span>Congo River</span>, the <span>inland</span> and <span>sea deltas</span> of the <span>Niger River</span>, and the central <span>Indus River</span> valley. Vagrants have been seen in inland <span>Zaire</span>, <span>Malaysia</span>, on <span>Greenland</span>, and on the <span>Marianas</span>, <span>Palau</span> and <span>Yap</span> in <span>Micronesia</span>; they are regularly recorded on the <span>North American</span> coasts south to <span>California</span> and <span>South Carolina</span>.</p>
<p>Altogether, the Eurasian teal is much less common than its American counterpart, though still very plentiful. Its numbers are mainly assessed by counts of wintering birds; some 750,000 are recorded annually around the <span>Mediterranean</span> and <span>Black Seas</span>, 250,000 in <span>temperate</span> western <span>Europe</span>, and more than 110,000 in <span>Japan</span>. In 1990 and 1991, a more detailed census was undertaken, yielding over 210,000 birds wintering in <span>Iran</span>, some 109,000 in <span>Pakistan</span>, about 77,000 in <span>Azerbaijan</span>, some 37,000 in <span>India</span>, 28,000 in <span>Israel</span>, over 14,000 in <span>Turkmenistan</span> and almost 12,000 in <span>Taiwan</span>. It appears to be holding its own currently, with its slow decline of maybe 1&#x2013;2% annually in the 1990s &#x2013; presumably mainly due to drainage and <span>pollution</span> of wetlands &#x2013; not warranting action other than continuing to monitor the population and possibly providing better protection for <span>habitat</span> on the wintering grounds. The <span>IUCN</span> and <span>BirdLife International</span> classify the Eurasian teal as a species of <span>Least Concern</span>, unchanged from their assessment before the split of the more numerous <i>A. carolinensis</i>.</p>
<p>The Eurasian teal is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>This <span>dabbling duck</span> is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks. In flight, the fast, twisting flocks resemble <span>waders</span>; despite its short legs, it is also rather nimble on the ground by ducks' standards. In the breeding season, it is a common inhabitant of sheltered <span>freshwater</span> <span>wetlands</span> with some tall vegetation, such as <span>taiga</span> bogs or small <span>lakes</span> and <span>ponds</span> with extensive <span>reedbeds</span>. In winter, it is often seen in <span>brackish</span> waters and even in sheltered <span>inlets</span> and <span>lagoons</span> along the seashore.</p>
<p>The Eurasian teal usually feeds by dabbling, upending or grazing; it may submerge its head and on occasion even dive to reach food. In the breeding season it eats mainly <span>aquatic</span> <span>invertebrates</span>, such as <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>insects</span> and their <span>larvae</span>, <span>molluscs</span> and <span>worms</span>. In winter, it shifts to a largely <span>granivorous</span> diet, feeding on <span>seeds</span> of aquatic <span>plants</span> and <span>grasses</span>, including <span>sedges</span> and <span>grains</span>. <span>Diurnal</span> throughout the breeding season, in winter they are often <span>crepuscular</span> or even <span>nocturnal</span> feeders.</p>
<p>It nests on the ground, near water and under cover. The pairs form in the winter quarters and arrive on the breeding grounds together, starting about March. The breeding starts some weeks thereafter, not until May in the most northernly locations. The nest is a deep hollow lined with dry leaves and <span>down feathers</span>, built in dense vegetation near water. After the females have started laying, the males leave them and move away for shorter or longer distances, assembling in flocks on particular lakes where they <span>moult</span> into <span>eclipse plumage</span>; they will usually encounter their offspring only in winter quarters. The <span>clutch</span> may consist of 5&#x2013;16 eggs, but usually numbers 8&#x2013;11; they are incubated for 21&#x2013;23 days. The young leave the nest soon after hatching and are attended by the mother for about 25&#x2013;30 days, after which they <span>fledge</span>. The drakes and the hens with young generally move to the winter quarters separately. After the first winter, the young moult into adult plumage. The maximum recorded lifespan &#x2013; though it is not clear whether this refers to the common or the green-winged teal&#x2014;was over 27 years, which is rather high for such a small bird.</p>
