<p>The <b>red-billed teal</b> (<i>Anas erythrorhyncha</i>) is a <span>dabbling duck</span> which is an abundant resident breeder in southern and eastern <span>Africa</span> typically south of 10&#xB0; S. This <span>duck</span> is not <span>migratory</span>, but will fly great distances to find suitable waters. It is highly gregarious outside the <span>breeding season</span> and forms large <span>flocks</span>.</p>
<p>The red-billed teal is 43&#x2013;48 centimetres (17&#x2013;19&#xA0;in) long and has a blackish cap and nape, contrasting pale face, and bright red <span>bill</span>. The body <span>plumage</span> is a dull dark brown scalloped with white. Flight reveals that the secondary <span>flight feathers</span> are <span>buff</span> with a black stripe across them. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults.</p>
<p>This is a quiet species, but the displaying male has a <i>whzzt</i> <span>call</span>, whereas the female has a soft <span>Mallard-like</span> quack.</p>
<p>The red-billed teal is a bird of <span>freshwater</span> <span>habitats</span> in fairly open country and is an <span>omnivore</span>. It feeds by <span>dabbling</span> for plant food, or <span>foraging</span> on land mainly in the evening or at night. It nests on the ground in dense vegetation near water.</p>
<p>This is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
