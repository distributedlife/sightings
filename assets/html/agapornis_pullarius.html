<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is native to a wide <span>range</span> in Africa including <span>Angola</span>, <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Chad</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Equatorial Guinea</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Gabon</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Guinea</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Mali</span>, <span>Niger</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Sierra Leone</span>, <span>South Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Togo</span>, and <span>Uganda</span>.
