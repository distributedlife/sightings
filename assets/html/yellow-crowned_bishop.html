<p>The <b>Yellow-crowned Bishop</b> (<i>Euplectes afer</i>) is a species of <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Ploceidae</span> native to <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. It is highly <span>sexually dimorphic</span> in its breeding season, during which the male adopts a distinctive yellow and black plumage, contrasting with the female's predominantly brown coloration. Three subspecies are recognised.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-crowned Bishop was first described by the German <span>naturalist</span> <span>Johann Friedrich Gmelin</span> in 1789. It and the <span>Fire-fronted Bishop</span> have occasionally been placed in the separate genus <i>Taha</i> but <span>DNA</span> places it in <i>Euplectes</i>, but with no close relatives. In captivity it has interbred with the <span>Northern Red Bishop</span>. Alternate common names include: Golden Bishop, Napoleon Bishop, Napoleon Weaver, Black-winged Golden Bishop, Goudgeelvink (in Afrikaans), Napoleonweber (in Dutch), Euplecte vorab&#xE9; (in French), Napoleonweber (in German), and Obispo Coronigualdo (in Spanish).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Three subspecies of the Yellow-crowned Bishop are now recognized.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-crowned Bishop is 95&#x2013;105&#xA0;mm (3.7&#x2013;4.1&#xA0;in) in length and 15&#xA0;g (0.53&#xA0;oz) in weight. During the breeding season it is sexually dimorphic&#x2014;that is, the observable characteristics of the males become more apparent. During the breeding season, the male has distinctive golden yellow and black <span>plumage</span>. The bill of both sexes is short and conical. The color of the male's bill is black during breeding season; by contrast, during non-breeding season, the male's bill is horn in color, as is the female's. The legs and feet are pinkish brown. The male has a black lower face, throat, breast and belly, a wide black collar on the back of the neck, and a brilliant yellow crown, forehead, and hindcrown. There is a yellow patch on the shoulder, and the rump and back are yellow. The wings and tail are brown. During non-breeding seasons the male <span>plumage</span> looks like the female plumage. The female Yellow-crowned Bishop has pale brown upperparts, with darker streaking. The eyebrow is paler and the underparts are off-white with fine dark streaks on the breast and flanks.</p>
<p>The male in breeding plumage resembles the <span>Yellow Bishop</span>, but the latter species is larger and lacks the yellow crown. Non-breeding males and females can be confused with those of the <span>Southern Red Bishop</span>, but have white rather than the buff-coloured underparts of the latter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-crowned Bishop is native to the African countries of: <span>Angola</span>, <span>Benin</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Burkina Faso</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Central African Republic</span>, <span>Chad</span>, <span>Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Ivory Coast</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Gabon</span>, <span>Gambia</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Guinea</span>, <span>Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Liberia</span>, <span>Mali</span>, <span>Mauritania</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Niger</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Sierra Leone</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Togo</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>. It has been introduced in the following countries: <span>the US (Florida)</span>, <span>Jamaica</span>, <span>Japan</span>, <span>Portugal</span>, <span>Puerto Rico</span>, and <span>Venezuela</span>. It prefers habitats such as grasslands, <span>vlies</span>, and <span>pans</span>. It likes <span>wheat</span> and <span>sorghum</span> fields, and weedy vegetation along wetlands.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-crowned Bishop eats insects, grain, and seeds. It lives in flocks with both males and females. In non-breeding seasons the flocks may contain <span>weavers</span> and <span>sparrows</span>. The call is a "high-pitched, rasping, buzzing swizzling, somewhat insect-like: <i>zzzzzzz, zzit, zzit, zzzz</i>". Nesting is November&#x2013;May, peaking from December&#x2013;March, and males are <span>polygynous</span>, but the males do not breed in colonies. Each male will build two or more oval nests with a top opening, attracting a female to each nest by flaring their yellow feathers and display flights. Yellow-crowned Bishop are <span>gregarious</span> and <span>nomadic</span>, wandering to breeding areas in response to rainfall. Nests are built among standing stems of grasses or <span>sedges</span> or shrubs. Bent over stems of live grass help hide the nest. The female will lay from two to four white eggs. Egg incubation is done solely by the females and lasts 12&#x2013;14 days. Newborn chicks leave the nest after 11&#x2013;13 days and are fully independent after an additional five weeks.</p>
