<p>The <b>Cape longclaw</b> or <b>orange-throated longclaw</b> (<i>Macronyx capensis</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Motacillidae</span>, which comprises the <span>longclaws</span>, <span>pipits</span> and <span>wagtails</span>. It occurs in <span>Southern Africa</span> in <span>Zimbabwe</span> and southern and eastern <span>South Africa</span>. This species is found in coastal and mountain grassland, often near water.</p>
<p>The Cape longclaw is a 19&#x2013;20&#xA0;cm long. The adult male has a grey head with a buff <span>supercilium</span> and a streaked blackish back. It has a bright orange <span>gorget</span>, black breast band and otherwise yellow underparts. The female is duller, having a yellow throat and much weaker breast band. The juvenile has a dirty yellow throat, indistinct breast band, and yellowish white underparts.</p>
<p>The Cape longclaw is usually found in pairs throughout the year. It feeds on the ground on insects and some seeds. The song is a musical <i>cheewit cheewit</i>, the contact call is <i>tsweet</i>, and there is also a mewling alarm call.</p>
<p>This species has a striking resemblance to the unrelated <span>icterid</span> <span>meadowlarks</span>, grassland birds of the <span>Americas</span>. This is presumably due to <span>convergent evolution</span>.</p>
