<p>The <b>crested honey buzzard</b> (<i>Pernis ptilorhyncus</i>) is a <span>bird of prey</span> in the family <span>Accipitridae</span> which also includes many other diurnal <span>raptors</span> such as <span>kites</span>, <span>eagles</span> and <span>harriers</span>. This species is also known as the <b>Oriental honey buzzard</b>.</p>

<p>Despite its name, this species is not related to <i>Buteo</i> <span>buzzards</span>, and is taxonomically closer to the kites. It appears long-necked with a small head (resembling that of a pigeon), and soars on flat wings. The head lacks a strong supraciliary ridge giving it a very un-raptor-like facial appearance. It has a long tail and a short head crest. It is brown above, but not as dark as honey buzzard, and paler below. There is a dark throat stripe. Unusually for a large bird of prey, the sexes can be distinguished. The male has a blue-grey head, while the female's head is brown. She is slightly larger and darker than the male. The male has a black tail with a white band, whilst the female resembles female honey buzzard.</p>
<p>It breeds in <span>Asia</span> from central <span>Siberia</span> east to <span>Japan</span>. It is a summer <span>migrant</span> to Siberia, wintering in tropical south east Asia. Elsewhere it is more-or-less resident. It is a specialist feeder, living mainly on the <span>larvae</span> and nests of <span>wasps</span>, although it will take other small insect prey such as cicadas.</p>
<p>The crested honey buzzard breeds in <span>woodland</span>, and is inconspicuous except in the spring, when the mating display includes wing-clapping. The display of roller-coasting in flight and fluttering wings at the peak of the ascent are characteristic of the genus <i>Pernis</i>.</p>
<p>It is larger and longer winged than its western counterpart, the <span>European honey buzzard</span>, <i>Pernis apivorus</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mimicry">Mimicry</span></h2>
<p>It has been suggested that the similarity in plumage between juvenile crested honey buzzard and the <i>Spizaetus</i> <span>hawk-eagles</span> has arisen as a partial protection against predation by larger raptors. The eagles have stronger bills and talons, and are likely to be less vulnerable than the <i>Pernis</i> species.</p>
<p>Similar mimicry is shown by the juveniles of the European honey buzzard, which resembles the <span>common buzzard</span>. Although the <span>northern goshawk</span> is capable of killing both species, it is likely to be more cautious about attacking the better protected <i>Buteo</i> species.</p>
