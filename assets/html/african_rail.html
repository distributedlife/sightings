<p>The <b>African rail</b> (<i>Rallus caerulescens</i>) is a small <span>wetland</span> bird of the <span>rail family</span>.</p>
<p>Its breeding habitat is <span>marshes</span> and reedbeds across eastern and southern <span>Africa</span> from <span>Ethiopia</span> to <span>South Africa</span>. Many birds are permanent residents, but some undertake <span>seasonal movements</span> in response to the availability of wetland.</p>
<p>Adults are 28&#x2013;30&#xA0;cm long, and have mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey underparts, with black-and-white barring on the flanks and undertail. This is the only <i>Rallus</i> species with a plain back. The body is flattened laterally to allow easier passage through the reeds. They have long toes, a short tail and a long slim dull red bill. The legs are red.</p>
<p>The African rail nests in a dry location in marsh vegetation, both sexes building the cup nest. The typical clutch is 2-6 heavily spotted creamy-white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes for about 20 days to hatching Immature birds are similar to the adults, but the blue-grey is replaced by buff. The precocial downy chicks are black, as with all rails.</p>

<p>These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat <span>insects</span>, crabs and other small aquatic animals.</p>
<p>African rails are secretive in the breeding season, but are easier to see than many other rail species, especially in the morning. They are noisy <span>birds</span>, with a trilled whistled <i>treee-tee-tee-tee-tee call</i>.</p>
