<p>The <b>pygmy falcon,</b> or <b>African pygmy falcon</b> (<i>Polihierax semitorquatus</i>), is a <span>falcon</span> that lives in eastern and southern <span>Africa</span> and is the smallest <span>raptor</span> on the continent. As a small falcon, only 19 to 20&#xA0;cm long, it preys on insects, small reptiles, and small mammals.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Adult pygmy falcons are white below and on the face, grey above, and females having a chestnut back. There are white "eye spots" on the nape. Juveniles have a brown back, duller than adult females, and a rufous wash on the breast. The flight feathers of the wings are spotted black and white (more black above, more white below); the tail is barred black and white.</p>
<p>The flight is low and undulating. In size, pattern, and the habit of perching upright on an exposed branch or treetop, this species resembles some <span>shrikes</span>.</p>
<p>The call is "a high-pitched <i>kikiKIK</i>, repeated" (Kenya) or "a 'chip-chip' and a 'kik-kik-kik-kik'" (southern Africa).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range.2C_habitat.2C_and_population">Range, habitat, and population</span></h2>
<p>The pygmy falcon inhabits dry bush. The subspecies <i>P. s. castanonotus</i> occurs from <span>Sudan</span> to <span>Somalia</span> and south to <span>Uganda</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>; <i>P. s. semitorquatus</i> occurs from <span>Angola</span> to northern <span>South Africa</span>. This range is estimated to have an area of 2.7 million km, and the total population is estimated to be between 100,000 and 1 million birds.</p>

<p>In Kenya, pygmy falcons nest in <span>white-headed buffalo weaver</span> nests, and the ranges of the two birds coincide. In southern Africa, they are found around <span>red-billed buffalo weaver</span> nests but predominantly nest in the vacant rooms of <span>sociable weaver</span> nests, which are large and multichambered&#x2014;even if the sociable weavers still have an active colony in the nest. Despite being bird-eaters and bigger than sociable weavers, the pygmy falcons largely leave the latter alone, though they do occasionally catch and eat nestlings and even adults.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Polyandry">Polyandry</span></h2>
<p>Pygmy falcons occasionally engage in polyandrous relationships, where there are more than two adults living together and tending nestlings. There are four potential reasons for this behaviour: defence, co-operative polyandry, delayed dispersal of offspring, and thermoregulation (warmth). Corroboration for the last is that in winter African pygmy falcons nest further inside the nest of sociable weavers, where there is better insulation.</p>
