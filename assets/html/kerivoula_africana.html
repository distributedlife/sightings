<p>The <b>Tanzanian Woolly Bat</b> (<i><b>Kerivoula africana</b></i>) is a species of <span>vesper bat</span> in the <span>Vespertilionidae</span> family. It is found only in <span>Tanzania</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The natural <span>habitat</span> of the Tanzanian woolly bat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland <span>forests</span>. It is threatened by <span>habitat loss</span> through the conversion of coastal wetlands to <span>subsistence agriculture</span> and coastal forests being subject to <span>logging</span> by the timber industry and local use. Habitat loss impacts this bat fairly drastically as its area of occupancy is estimated to be less than 500 square kilometers. Additionally, all members of this species are estimated to live in only five different locations within the 500 square kilometers. This species is currently classified as endangered by the <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> Red List.</p>
