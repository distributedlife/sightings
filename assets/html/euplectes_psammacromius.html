<p>The <b>Montane Widowbird</b> (<i>Euplectes psammacromius</i>), also known as the <b>Mountain Marsh Widowbird</b> is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Ploceidae</span> family. It is an endemic resident of the eastern afro-mountain grassland (northeast Zambia, north Malawi and highlands of southwest Tanzania). Like all widowbirds the difference between male and female appearance is prominent during breeding season. In breeding season males molt into a black breeding plumage including long tail feathers and yellow shoulder patches (these patches have a discrete appearance during the non-breeding period). During this period males defend territories in early morning after sunrise and in the evening before sunset. Outside breeding season male and female appearance is similar, they are both speckled brown and black.</p>
