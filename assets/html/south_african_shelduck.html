<p>The <b>South African shelduck</b> or <b>Cape shelduck</b> (<i>Tadorna cana</i>) is a species of <span>shelduck</span>, a group of large goose-like birds which are part of the bird family <span>Anatidae</span>, which also includes the <span>swans</span>, <span>geese</span> and <span>ducks</span>.</p>
<p>This is a 64&#xA0;cm long bird which breeds in southern <span>Africa</span>, mainly in <span>Namibia</span> and <span>South Africa</span>. In the southern winter, many birds move north-east from the breeding range to favoured moulting grounds, where sizable concentrations occur.</p>
<p>This species is mainly associated with lakes and rivers in fairly open country, breeding in disused mammal holes, usually those of the <span>aardvark</span>.</p>
<p>Adult South African shelduck have ruddy bodies and wings strikingly marked with black, white and green. The male has a grey head, and the female has a white face and black crown, nape and neck sides.</p>
<p>South African shelduck is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>The genus name <i>Tadorna</i> comes from Celtic roots and means "pied waterfowl", essentially the same as the <span>English</span> "shelduck".</p>
