<p>The <b>Long-billed Pipit</b> or <b>Brown Rock Pipit</b> (<i>Anthus similis</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> which has a wide distribution. A number of subspecies have been created for the populations in <span>Africa</span>, through the <span>Arabian peninsula</span> and <span>South Asia</span>. The systematics of this complex is yet to be clarified. Most birds are residents or short distance <span>migrants</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>This is a complex group with several similar looking birds with very disjunct distributions and the exact patterns of phylogeny are yet to be determined. Several subspecies that were formerly placed within this species have been raised to full species status.</p>

<p>The <span>Woodland Pipit</span> (<i>Anthus nyassae</i>), an inhabitant of <span>miombo</span> woodland in south-central Africa, was formerly treated as a <span>subspecies</span> of this bird but is now usually regarded as a separate species. Some authorities also split <b>Bannerman's Pipit</b> (<i>Anthus (similis) bannermani</i>), a bird of mountain grassland in <span>West Africa</span>.</p>
<p>The nominate race was described by <span>Thomas C. Jerdon</span> in 1840 from peninsular India. This form occurs along the Western Ghats and into the Nilgiris and Palni Hills. A darker race <i>travancoriensis</i> was described by <span>Sidney Dillon Ripley</span> in 1953 for the form possibly restricted south of the Palghat Gap. Subspecies <i>decaptus</i> described by <span>Richard Meinertzhagen</span> is found in Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of northwestern India, while <i>jerdoni</i> is found along the Himalayan foothills east to Nepal. The population <i>yamethini</i> is somewhat disjunct and found in Myanmar. Several other races are described in the West Asian region and from Africa.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This is a medium-large <span>pipit</span>, 16-17.5&#xA0;cm long, but is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly sandy grey above and whitish or pale buff below. It is very similar to the <span>Tawny Pipit</span>, but is slightly larger, has a longer tail and a longer dark bill.</p>
<p>The Long-billed Pipit&#x2019;s flight is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic <i>chupp</i> call, similar to <span>Desert Lark</span>. Its song is like that of the Tawny Pipit, but slower and more varied, <i>sri...churr...sri...churr&#x2026;sri..churr</i>. Like its relatives, Long-billed Pipit eats seeds and <span>insects</span>.</p>
<p>The Long-billed Pipit&#x2019;s breeding habitat is dry open slopes with rocks and low vegetation. The nest is on the ground, with 2-4 eggs being laid.</p>
