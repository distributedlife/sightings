<p><b>Salvin's prion</b>, <i>Pachyptila salvini</i>, also known as <b>medium-billed prion</b>, is a species of <span>seabird</span> in the <span>petrel</span> family <span>Procellariidae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Salvin's prion is a member of the <i><span>Pachyptila</span></i> <span>genus</span>, and along with the <span>blue petrel</span>, they make up the <span>prions</span>. They in turn are members of the <span>Procellariidae</span> <span>family</span>, and the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>. The prions are small and typically eat just <span>zooplankton</span>; however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Salvin's prion has two <span>subspecies</span>:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The name <i>Pachyptila</i> comes from the <span>Greek</span> words <i>pakhus</i> and <i>ptilon</i>. <i>Pakhus</i> means "thick" or "stout" and <i>ptilon</i> means "a feather". Also from the Greek language, <i>prion</i> comes from the word <i>pri&#x14D;n</i> meaning "a saw", which is in reference to its serrated edges of its <span>bill</span>. The species is named for the <span>British</span> <span>ornithologist</span> <span>Osbert Salvin</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Salvin's prion is a small 29&#xA0;cm (11&#xA0;in) petrel with grey and white <span>plumage</span>, and a blue bill. Like the <span>broad-billed prion</span> it has <span>lamellae</span> in its <span>bill</span> in order to filter seawater for food.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This small <span>prion</span> breeds <span>colonially</span> on a number of <span>subantarctic</span> islands in the southern <span>Indian Ocean</span>. The colonies of medium-billed prions are attended <span>nocturnally</span> in order to avoid predation by <span>skuas</span>. The nests are concealed in burrows usually dug into soil. Nests are attended regularly for several months prior to breeding. A single egg is laid in November or early December, which is <span>incubated</span> for around 50 days. Both parents share the incubation duties and feed the chick once it is hatched. The chicks <span>fledge</span> around 60 days after hatching.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The main components of its diet are <span>amphipods</span> and <span>krill</span>, although it will also take <span>fish</span> and <span>squid</span>. In addition to filter feeding food is obtained by seizing and hydroplaning.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Salvin's prion breeds principally on <span>&#xCE;le aux Cochons</span> in the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, where four million pairs are thought to breed. Other breeding colonies include <span>Prince Edward Island</span>, <span>St Paul Island</span> and <span>Amsterdam Island</span>. At sea they range from <span>South Africa</span> eastwards to <span>New Zealand</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Salvin's prion is not considered threatened. Although numbers have declined on some islands where <span>rats</span> and <span>feral cats</span> have been <span>introduced</span>, the world population is estimated at around 12 million birds. Consequently, they are given a classification of <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
