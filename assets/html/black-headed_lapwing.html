<p>The <b>black-headed lapwing</b> or <b>black-headed plover</b> (<i>Vanellus tectus</i>) is a large <span>lapwing</span>, a group of largish <span>waders</span> in the family <span>Charadriidae</span>. It is a resident breeder across sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span> from <span>Senegal</span> to <span>Ethiopia</span>, although it has seasonal movements. It lays two or three eggs on a ground scrape.</p>
<p>These are conspicuous and unmistakable <span>birds</span>. They are medium-large waders with a black head other than a white forehead, lower face and bands across the rear head and nape. There is a wispy black crest like <span>northern lapwing</span> and the bill and legs are red. The tail is white, tipped black.</p>
<p>In flight, the black-headed lapwing's upperwings have black flight feathers and brown coverts separated by a white bar. The underwings are white with black flight feathers.</p>
<p>This species is a common breeder in wet lowland habitats close to water. It often feeds in drier habitats, such as golf courses and grassy scrub, picking <span>insects</span> and other invertebrates from the ground.</p>
<p>The black-headed lapwing has a metallic <i>tink-tink</i> call.</p>
