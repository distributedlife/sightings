<p>The <b>marsh sandpiper</b> (<i>Tringa stagnatilis</i>) is a small <span>wader</span>. It is a rather small <span>shank</span>, and breeds in open grassy <span>steppe</span> and <span>taiga</span> <span>wetlands</span> from easternmost <span>Europe</span> to central <span>Asia</span>. It resembles a small elegant <span>greenshank</span>, with a long fine <span>bill</span> and very long yellowish legs. Like the greenshank, it is greyish brown in breeding <span>plumage</span>, paler in winter, and has a white wedge up its back that is visible in flight. However, it is more closely related to the <span>common redshank</span> and the <span>wood sandpiper</span> (Pereira &amp; Baker, 2005). Together, they form a group of smallish shanks which tend to have red or reddish legs, and in breeding plumage are generally a subdued, light brown above with some darker mottling, with a pattern of somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck. The length is 22&#x2013;26&#xA0;cm (8.7&#x2013;10.2&#xA0;in), wingspan is 55&#x2013;59&#xA0;cm (22&#x2013;23&#xA0;in) and weight is 45&#x2013;120&#xA0;g (1.6&#x2013;4.2&#xA0;oz).</p>
<p>It is a <span>migratory</span> species, with majority of birds wintering in <span>Africa</span>, and <span>India</span> with fewer migrating to Southeast <span>Asia</span> and <span>Australia</span>. They prefer to winter on fresh water wetlands such as <span>swamps</span> and lakes and are usually seen singly or in small groups.</p>
<p>These birds forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud. They mainly eat insects, and similar small <span>prey</span>.</p>
<p>The marsh sandpiper is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
