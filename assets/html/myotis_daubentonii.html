<p><b>Daubenton's bat</b> (<i>Myotis daubentonii</i>), is a <span>Eurasian</span> <span>bat</span> with quite short ears. It ranges from <span>Britain</span> to <span>Japan</span> (<span>Hokkaido</span>) and is considered to be increasing its numbers in many areas.</p>
<p>The name commemorates the French naturalist <span>Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Daubenton's bat is a medium-sized to small species. The bat's fluffy fur is brownish-grey on the back and silvery-grey on the underside. Juveniles have darker fur than adults. The bats have reddish-pink faces and noses, but the area around the eyes is bare. When the bat is agitated, the ears are held at right angles. The wings and tail membrane are dark brown.</p>
<p>Daubenton's bat is typically 45 to 55&#xA0;mm long, with an average wingspan of 240 to 275&#xA0;mm, and weighs between 7 and 15 g.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lifespan">Lifespan</span></h2>
<p>Daubenton's bats can live for up to 22 years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Daubenton's bat is found throughout Ireland and Europe, and as far as Japan and Korea. The bat is mostly found in woodlands and always chooses roosts close to water sources such as rivers or canals.</p>
<p>Summer colonies are formed in underground caves, tunnels, cellars, mines, and underneath bridges. These colonies are also always near water. Daubenton's bat also hibernates in the same type of locations from September to late March or April.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hunting_and_diet">Hunting and diet</span></h2>
<p>Daubenton's bat is insectivorous and uses <span>echolocation</span> to find prey and orient itself at night. Bats emit sounds too high in frequency for humans to detect and interpret the echoes created to build a "sound picture" of their surroundings. Daubenton's bat emits echolocation calls of frequencies between 32 and 85&#xA0;kHz, though typical calls peak at 45 to 50&#xA0;kHz and have a duration of 3.3 ms.</p>
<p>The bats emerge at twilight to hunt for insects over the water. Their main diets consist of small flies, midges, mayflies, and moths. Daubenton's bat often eats its prey while still in flight. A seven-gram Daubenton's bat often returns weighing 11 grams after a one hour feeding, increasing its body weight by 57%.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>Mating occurs in autumn and fertilisation takes place the following spring. Females gather in maternity colonies of 40 to 80 bats during June and July. Daubenton's bat is able to fly three weeks after birth and reaches independence at 6 to 8 wk of age.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>All bats in Britain are protected under Schedule 5 of the <span>Wildlife and Countryside Act</span> of 1981. The bats are also protected by the <span>Conservation Regulations</span> of 1994.</p>
<p>Daubenton's bat is an endangered species in Germany and Austria.</p>
