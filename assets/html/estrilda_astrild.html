<p>The <b>Common Waxbill</b> (<i>Estrilda astrild</i>), also known as the <b>St Helena Waxbill</b>, is a small <span>passerine</span> bird belonging to the <span>estrildid finch</span> family. It is native to <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> but has been introduced to many other regions of the world and now has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;. It is popular and easy to keep in captivity.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a small bird, 11 to 13 centimetres in length with a wingspan of 12 to 14 centimetres and a weight of 7 to 10&#xA0;grams. It has a slender body with short rounded wings and a long graduated tail. The bright red bill of the adult is the colour of <span>sealing wax</span> giving the bird its name. The plumage is mostly grey-brown, finely barred with dark brown. There is a red stripe through the eye and the cheeks and throat are whitish. There is often a pinkish flush to the underparts and a reddish stripe along the centre of the belly depending on the subspecies. The rump is brown and the tail and vent are dark. Females are similar to the males but are paler with less red on the belly. Juveniles are duller with little or no red on the belly, fainter dark barring and a black bill.</p>
<p>Similar species include the <span>Black-rumped</span>, <span>Crimson-rumped</span> and <span>Black-lored Waxbills</span>. The Black-rumped Waxbill is black rather than brown on the rump and has a pale vent (area underneath the tail). The Crimson-rumped Waxbill has a dark bill, red rump and some red on the wings and tail. The Black-lored Waxbill (found only in the <span>Democratic Republic of Congo</span>) has a black rather than red stripe through the eye.</p>
<p>The Common Waxbill has a variety of twittering and buzzing calls and a distinctive high-pitched flight-call. The simple <span>song</span> is harsh and nasal and descends on the last note.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Native_range">Native range</span></h3>
<p>There are about 17 <span>subspecies</span> distributed widely across much of <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. They are present in most parts of <span>East</span>, <span>Central</span> and <span>Southern Africa</span> except for regions of desert or dense forest. In <span>West Africa</span> they are more local with the main population centred on <span>Sierra Leone</span>, <span>Liberia</span> and the <span>Ivory Coast</span>. Common Waxbills inhabit open country with long <span>grass</span> and rank vegetation. They are often found near water in marshes and among <span>reeds</span>. They can be tame and will enter gardens, parks and farmland.</p>

<p>Birds have often escaped from captivity or been deliberately released. Breeding populations have become established in many places where the climate is sufficiently warm and where there is a sufficient supply of grass seeds. They are now found on many islands around Africa: <span>Saint Helena</span>, <span>Ascension Island</span>, the <span>Cape Verde</span> Islands, <span>S&#xE3;o Tom&#xE9; and Pr&#xED;ncipe</span>, <span>Mauritius</span>, <span>R&#xE9;union</span>, <span>Rodrigues</span>, the <span>Seychelles</span> and <span>Ile Amsterdam</span>. They may possibly be native on some of these islands. In Europe the Common Waxbill has become widespread in <span>Portugal</span> and is spreading through <span>Spain</span>. There are small populations on <span>Madeira</span> and <span>Gran Canaria</span> and it has recently appeared on <span>Tenerife</span> and the <span>Azores</span>. In the <span>Americas</span> waxbills are found in <span>Trinidad</span>, several parts of <span>Brazil</span> and there are a few on <span>Bermuda</span>. In the <span>Pacific</span> there are populations on <span>New Caledonia</span>, <span>Efate</span> Island in <span>Vanuatu</span>, <span>Tahiti</span> and the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span>. In Spain it has been introduced in the largest cities in last ten years and is now quite commonly seen in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, as well as along the Spanish-Portuguese border.</p>

<p>The <span>nest</span> is a large ball of criss-crossed grass stems with a long downward-pointing entrance tube on one side. It is built in a cavity, usually low down amongst dense vegetation. A rudimentary second nest ("cock's nest") may be built on top where the male sleeps. Four to seven white <span>eggs</span> are laid. They are <span>incubated</span> for 11 to 13 days and the young birds <span>fledge</span> 17 to 21 days after hatching. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The timing of the breeding season varies in different parts of the world. Nests may be <span>parasitized</span> by the <span>Pin-tailed Whydah</span> which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches. In captivity they will breed in an <span>aviary</span> and can raise four <span>broods</span> in a year.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h2>
<p>The diet consists mainly of grass <span>seeds</span> but <span>insects</span> are also eaten on occasions, especially during the breeding season when more <span>protein</span> is needed. The waxbills typically forage in flocks which may contain hundreds or even thousands of birds. They usually feed by clinging to the stems with their long, spindly claws and picking from the flower heads but they will also search for fallen seeds on the ground. They need to drink regularly as the seeds contain little water.</p>
