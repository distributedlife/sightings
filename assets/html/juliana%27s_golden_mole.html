<p><b>Juliana&#x2019;s golden mole</b> (<i>Neamblysomus julianae</i>) is a <span>golden mole</span> endemic to <span>South Africa</span>. It is listed as an <span>endangered species</span> due to habitat loss and a restricted range. Golden moles are an ancient group of mammals who live mostly below ground. They have shiny coats of dense fur and a streamlined, formless appearance. They have no visible eyes or ears; in fact, they are blind - the small eyes are covered with hairy skin. The ears are small and are hidden in the animal's fur.</p>
<p>Juliana's golden mole weighs 21&#x2013;75 g (0.75&#x2013;2.7 oz). It is confined to sandy soils, often pockets of weathered sandstone associated with rocky ridges. It is also common in well-irrigated gardens. Usually two young are born, sometimes one. Golden moles eat <span>invertebrates</span> such as insects, earthworms and snails. Their young are born in a grass-lined cavity in the ground. Golden moles usually dig their tunnels just below the ground.</p>
<p>Juliana&#x2019;s golden mole is found in <span>Pretoria</span> (Gauteng), <span>Nylstroom</span> (Limpopo Province) and <span>Kruger National Park</span> (Mpumalanga), <span>South Africa</span>. Juliana&#x2019;s golden mole is locally common. However, its distribution is patchy because of its specialized habitat requirements. There are no data on population size. The population on Bronberg Ridge outside Pretoria is being severely affected by intensive urbanization and a mining operation, and it is considered to be critically endangered. The Nylsvley population in Limpopo occurs in farmlands (adjoining the Nylsvley Nature Reserve) that are subject to habitat alteration and potential degradation.</p>
