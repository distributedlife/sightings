<p><b>Topis</b> (<i>Damaliscus korrigum</i>) are a highly social and fast antelope <span>species</span> of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Damaliscus</span></i>. The vernacular name "topi" applies not only to the species but also to two subspecies <i>D. k. jimela</i> and <i>D. k. topi</i>, while the name <span>korrigum</span> or tiang applies to the subspecies <i>D. k. korrigum</i>. Along with the <span>Bangweulu Tsessebe</span> this species was formerly included in the <span>common tsessebe</span>. The species is to be found in the <span>savannas</span>, <span>semi-deserts</span>, and floodplains of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>.</p>

<p>Topi resemble <span>hartebeest</span> but have a darker coloration and lack sharply angled horns. They have elongated heads, a distinct hump at the base of the neck, and reddish brown bodies with dark purple patchings on their upper legs. They also have a mask-like dark coloration on the face. Their horns are ringed and <span>lyrate</span> shaped. Their coats are made of short, shiny hairs. They range in mass from 68 to 160&#xA0;kg (150 to 353&#xA0;lb). Head-and-body length can range from 150 to 210&#xA0;cm (59 to 83&#xA0;in) and the tail measures 40&#x2013;60&#xA0;cm (16&#x2013;24&#xA0;in). They are a tall species, ranging in height from 100 to 130&#xA0;cm (39 to 51&#xA0;in) at the shoulder. Males tend to be larger and darker than females. Topi also have <span>preorbital glands</span> that secrete clear oil and the front legs have hoof glands. When pressed they have been known to reach speeds in excess of 80&#xA0;km/h (50 mph) although they typically travel at a jog. They are one of the fastest antelopes in Africa.</p>

<p>The topi has a long but patchy distribution as it prefers certain grasslands in arid and savanna <span>biomes</span>. Human hunting and habitat destruction have further isolated their population. The following countries have been found to contain topi: <span>Benin</span>, <span>Burkina Faso</span>, <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Central African Republic</span>, <span>Chad</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Gambia</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Mali</span>, <span>Mauritania</span>, <span>Niger</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Togo</span>, and <span>Uganda</span>. The species is regionally <span>extinct</span> in <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Gambia</span>, <span>Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span>Mauritania</span>, and <span>Senegal</span>.</p>

Topi grazing in the <span>Maasai Mara</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Topi primarily live in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In <span>ecotone</span> habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay along the edge using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in length with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food topi tend to make small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When they have access to enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use <span>vantage points</span>, such as <span>termite mounds</span>, to get a good look at their surroundings.</p>
<p>Topi are usually either numerous or absent in an area. Scattered populations do not last long and either increase or die off. The health of topis in a population depends on access to green vegetation. Herds of topi migrate between pastures. The largest migration is in the <span>Serengeti</span>, where they join the wildebeests, zebras and gazelles. Predators of topi include <span>lions</span> and <span>spotted hyenas</span> with jackals being predators of newborns. They are especially targeted by hyenas. Nevertheless, topi tend to have a low predation rate when other species are present.</p>

Group of Topi</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The topi has what is possibly the most diverse social organization of the antelopes. Topi herds can take the form of "perennially sedentary-dispersion", "perennially mobile-aggregated" or something in between. This depends on the habitat and ecology of the areas they are in. In addition, the reproductive organization ranges between the traditional territorial system or resource defense <span>polygyny</span> herds to gatherings that contain short-lasting territories to <span>lek</span> systems. In patches of grassland surrounded by woodlands, topi live in the sedentary-dispersion mode. Males establish territories that attract herds of females with their offspring. Depending on the size of the patches, territories can be as large as 4&#xA0;km and sometimes border each other. The fidelity of a female to a territory can last three years in the Serengeti. The females in these territories function as part of the resident male&#x2019;s harem. These herds tend to be closed (except when new females are accepted) and both the male and his females defend the territory. When the resident male is absent, the dominant female may assume his behaviors, defending against outside topis of either sex using the <i>rocking canter</i> and performing the <i>high-stepping display</i>. In more densely populated areas, like those of <span>Queen Elizabeth National Park</span> in Uganda, topis move across the plain and set up territories during resting periods.</p>

Topi with young</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In areas such as the <span>Akagera National Park</span> in Rwanda and <span>Masai Mara National Reserve</span> in Kenya, topi males establish leks which are territories that are clustered together. These territories have little value outside of the males in them. The most dominant males occupy the center of the lek cluster and the less dominant occupy the periphery. Males mark their territories with dung piles and stand on them in an erect posture ready to fight any other male that tries to invade. Estrous females enter the leks both alone and in groups and mate with the males in the center of the lek cluster. Males further from the center may increase their reproductive success if they are near water. Females will compete with each other for the dominant males as females come into estrous for only one day of the year. Females prefer to mate with dominant males that they have mated with before, however males try to mate with as many new females as possible. As such favored males prefer to balance mating investment equally between females. Females, however, will aggressively disrupt copulations that their favored males have with other females. Subordinate females have their copulations interrupted more often than dominant females. Males will eventually counter-attack these females, refusing to mate with them any more.</p>
<p>The vast majority of births occur between October and December with half of them occurring in October. The parenting of the topi has characteristics of both the "hider" system (found in the <span>blesbok</span>) and the "follower" system (found in the <span>blue wildebeest</span>). Calves can follow their mothers immediately after birth and "may not 'lie out'". On the other hand, females separate themselves from the herd to calve and calves commonly seek hiding places during the night. A young stays with its mother for a year or until a new calf is born. Both yearling males and females can be found in bachelor herds.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>Although the topi is not widely threatened and remains common, it has been <span>extirpated</span> from many parts of its former range. The West African korrigum has been hit most by these threats as they were extirpated from four of the 12 countries in which they were native. Topi can be found in protected areas such as <span>Virunga National Park</span> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, <span>Queen Elizabeth National Park</span> in Uganda, <span>Akagera National Park</span> in Rwanda, the <span>Masai Mara</span> in Kenya and the <span>Serengeti National Park</span> in Tanzania.</p>
