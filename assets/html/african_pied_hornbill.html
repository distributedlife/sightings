<p>The <b>African pied hornbill</b>, <i>Tockus fasciatus</i>, is a bird of the <span>hornbill</span> family, a family of tropical <span>near-passerine</span> <span>birds</span> found in the <span>Old World</span>.</p>
<p>The African pied hornbill is a common resident breeder in much of equatorial Africa, from <span>The Gambia</span> to western <span>Uganda</span> and northern <span>Angola</span>. This is a bird of mainly forest habitats. The female lays up to four white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Morphology">Morphology</span></h2>
<p>This is a large bird, 54 centimetres (21&#xA0;in) in length. It has mainly black plumage, with white belly and tail tip. The long, curved black and yellow bill has a medium-sized <span>casque</span>. The sexes are similar, but the female has a smaller casque. Immature birds are duller, have a smaller bill, and no casque. The flight is undulating.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The African pied hornbill is omnivorous and eats fruit and insects. It feeds mainly in trees and is attracted to <span>Oil Palms</span>.</p>
<p>This conspicuous and gregarious bird advertises its presence with its whistling <i>pii-pii-pii-pii-</i> call.</p>
<p>When the chicks and the female are too big to fit in the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed the chicks.</p>
