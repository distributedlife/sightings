<p>The <b>Egyptian goose</b> (<i>Alopochen aegyptiaca</i>) is a member of the <span>duck</span>, <span>goose</span>, and <span>swan</span> <span>family</span> <span>Anatidae</span>. It is native to Africa south of the <span>Sahara</span> and the <span>Nile Valley</span>.</p>
<p>Egyptian geese were considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians, and appeared in much of their artwork. They have been raised for food and extensively bred in parts of Africa since they were domesticated by the ancient Egyptians. Because of their popularity chiefly as ornamental bird, escapes are common and small <span>feral</span> populations have become established in <span>Western Europe</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The Egyptian goose is believed to be most closely related to the <span>shelducks</span> (genus <i>Tadorna</i>) and their relatives, and is placed with them in the <span>subfamily</span> <span>Tadorninae</span>. It is the only extant member of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Alopochen</span></i>, which also contains closely related prehistoric and recently extinct species. <span>mtDNA</span> <span>cytochrome b</span> <span>sequence</span> data suggest that the relationships of <i>Alopochen</i> to <i>Tadorna</i> need further investigation.</p>
<p>Its generic name is based on Greek &#x1F00;&#x3BB;&#x3CE;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;&#x3BE; ('alopex') + &#x3C7;&#x3AE;&#x3BD; ('chen') = "fox-goose", referring to the colour of its back.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It swims well, and in flight looks heavy, more like a goose than a duck, hence the English name. It is 63&#x2013;73&#xA0;cm long.</p>
<p>The sexes of this species are identical in plumage, and the males average slightly larger. There is a fair amount of variation in plumage tone, with some birds greyer and others browner, but this is not sex- or age-related. A large part of the wings of mature birds is white, but in repose the white is hidden by the wing coverts. When it is aroused, either in alarm or aggression, the white begins to show. In flight or when the wings are fully spread in aggression the white is conspicuous.</p>
<p>The voices and vocalisations of the sexes differ, the male having a hoarse, subdued duck-like quack which seldom sounds unless it is aroused. The male Egyptian goose attracts its mate with an elaborate, noisy courtship display that includes honking, neck stretching and feather displays. The female has a far noisier raucous quack that frequently sounds in aggression and almost incessantly at the slightest disturbance when tending her young.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>This species breeds widely in <span>Africa</span> except in deserts and dense forests, and is locally abundant. They are found mostly in the <span>Nile Valley</span> and south of the <span>Sahara</span>. While not breeding, it disperses somewhat, sometimes making longer migrations northwards into arid regions of the <span>Sahel</span>. It has also been introduced elsewhere: <span>Great Britain</span>, the <span>Netherlands</span>, <span>France</span>, and <span>Germany</span> have self-sustaining populations which are mostly derived from escaped ornamental birds. Escapes have also bred on occasion in other places, such as <span>Florida</span> and <span>New Zealand</span>. The British population dates back to the 18th century, though only formally added to the British list in 1971. In Britain, it is found mainly in <span>East Anglia</span>, in parkland with lakes. It was officially declared a pest in the U.K. in 2009.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>This is a largely terrestrial species, which will also perch readily on trees and buildings. Egyptian geese typically eat seeds, leaves, grasses, and plant stems. Occasionally, they will eat locusts, worms, or other small animals.</p>
<p>Both sexes are aggressively territorial towards their own species when breeding and frequently pursue intruders into the air, attacking them in aerial "dogfights". Neighbouring pairs may even kill another's offspring for their own offsprings' survival as well as for more resources.</p>
<p>This species will nest in a large variety of situations, especially in holes in mature trees in parkland. The female builds the nest from reeds, leaves and grass, and both parents take turns incubating eggs. Egyptian geese usually pair for life. Both the male and female care for the offspring until they are old enough to care for themselves.</p>
