<p>The <b>yellow mongoose</b> (<i>Cynictis penicillata</i>), sometimes referred to as the <b>red meerkat</b>, is a small <span>mammal</span> averaging about 1 lb (1/2 kg) in weight and about 20 in (500 mm) in length. A member of the <span>mongoose</span> family, it lives in open country, from <span>semi-desert</span> <span>scrubland</span> to <span>grasslands</span> in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p><i>Cynictis penicillata</i> is the <span>only member</span> of its <span>genus</span>, but as many as twelve <span>subspecies</span> of yellow mongoose have been described. In general, the yellow mongoose has lighter highlights on the underbelly and chin, a bushy tail, and a complete lack of <span>sexual dimorphism</span>. Southern yellow mongooses are larger, have yellow or reddish fur, longer fur, and a longer <span>tail</span> with a characteristic white tip. Northern subspecies tend towards smaller size, grey colouration, a grey or darker grey tip to the tail, and shorter hair more appropriate to the hotter climate.</p>

<p>The yellow mongoose is <span>carnivorous</span>, consuming mostly <span>arthropods</span> but also other small mammals, <span>lizards</span>, <span>snakes</span> and <span>eggs</span> of all kinds.</p>
<p>The yellow mongoose is primarily <span>diurnal</span>, though <span>nocturnal</span> activity has been observed. Living in colonies of up to 20 individuals in a permanent underground <span>burrow</span> complex, the yellow mongoose will often co-exist with <span>Cape Ground Squirrels</span> or <span>suricates</span> and share maintenance of the warren, adding new tunnels and burrows as necessary. The tunnel system has many entrances, nearby which the yellow mongoose makes its <span>latrines</span>.</p>

<p>The <span>social structure</span> of the yellow mongoose is <span>hierarchical</span>, based around a central breeding pair and their most recent offspring. There are also subadults, the elderly, or adult relatives of the central pair. Male ranges tend to overlap, while females from other dens have contiguous non-overlapping ranges. Every day, the alpha male will mark members of his group with anal gland secretions, and his boundaries with facial and anal secretions, as well as urine. The alpha male also rubs his back against raised objects, leaving behind hair as a visual <span>marker of territory</span>. Other members of the group mark their dens with cheek secretions. Colony's members can be from 20-40 members.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Predators">Predators</span></h2>
<p><span>Predators</span> of the yellow mongoose are <span>birds of prey</span>, <span>snakes</span> and <span>jackals</span>. When frightened, the yellow mongoose will growl and secrete from its anal glands. It can also scream, bark, and purr, though these are exceptions, as the yellow mongoose is usually silent, and communicates mood and status through tail movements.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The mating season of the yellow mongoose is between July and September, and it gives birth underground between October and December, with no bedding material, in a clean chamber of the <span>burrow</span> system. Usually, two offspring are produced per pregnancy, and they are <span>weaned</span> at 10 weeks, reaching adult size after 10 months.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cynictis_penicillata_and_Rabies">Cynictis penicillata and Rabies</span></h2>
<p>There is some concern about the role of <i>Cynictis penicillata</i> as a <span>natural reservoir</span> of rabies. Most African wild animals will die within a several weeks of infection with rabies, but it seems that certain genetic strains of the yellow mongoose can carry it asymptomatically, but infectiously, for years.</p>
