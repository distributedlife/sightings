<p>The <b>yellow-billed duck</b> (<i>Anas undulata</i>) is a 51&#x2013;58&#xA0;cm long <span>dabbling duck</span> which is an abundant resident breeder in southern and eastern <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>This <span>duck</span> is not <span>migratory</span>, but will wander in the dry season to find suitable waters. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms large flocks.</p>
<p>These are <span>mallard</span>-sized mainly grey ducks with a darker head and bright yellow bill. The wings are whitish below, and from above show a white-bordered green speculum.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, and juveniles are slightly duller than adults. The north-eastern race is darker and has a brighter bill and blue <span>speculum</span>.</p>
<p>It is a bird of freshwater habitats in fairly open country and feeds by dabbling for plant food mainly in the evening or at night. It nests on the ground in dense vegetation near water. The clutch numbers between six and twelve eggs.</p>
<p>The male has a <span>teal-like</span> whistle, whereas the female has a mallard-like quack.</p>
<p>There are two subspecies of the yellow-billed duck: A. undulata rueppelli (northern yellow-billed duck) A. undulata undulata (southern yellow-billed duck)</p>
<p>The yellow-billed duck is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. The southern <span>nominate subspecies</span> is declining due to competition and <span>hybridization</span> with feral <span>mallards</span> (Rhymer 2006).</p>
