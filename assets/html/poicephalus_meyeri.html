<p>The <b>Meyer's Parrot</b> (<i>Poicephalus meyeri</i>) is a small (about 21&#xA0;cm, 90-130g), stocky African <span>parrot</span>. Meyer's parrots display a dull brown head, back and tail, green or blue-green abdomen, blue rump and bright yellow markings on the carpal joint of the wings. Most subspecies have some yellow on the top of the head as well. Forshaw (1989) recognizes six subspecies of <i>P. meyeri</i> which vary in home range, size and in markings, including the extent of yellow markings on the head and wings and intensity of turquoise markings on the abdomen and rump. The name commemorates the German ornithologist <span>Bernhard Meyer</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The six subspecies are:</p>

<p>The aces <i>P. m. damarensis</i> and <i>P. m. reichenowi</i> lack yellow markings on the head and <i>P. m. transvaalensis</i> may have little or not yellow on head. Belly and rump colours vary according to race from turquoise or blue to green.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Meyer's parrots are native to the plateau woodlands of sub-Saharan <span>Africa</span> where they occur in several woodland types including <span>miombo</span>, <span>savanna</span> woodlands, wooded grasslands and forests bordering watercourses or agricultural land. They are found in high densities in the <span>Okavango Delta</span> region of Botswana.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_and_feeding">Food and feeding</span></h3>
<p>Their wild diet includes fruits, seeds, nuts, berries and cultivated crops. Seeds of the various <span>leguminous</span> trees of the African woodlands are especially favoured, providing their staple food in some areas. Although they normally travel in pairs or small flocks, wild Meyer's Parrots may gather in much larger numbers where food is plentiful. In drought years they wander in search of food.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The Meyer's parrot nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and there are usually three or four in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 28 days and the chicks leave the nest about 60 days after hatching.</p>

<p>Meyer's Parrots are still common in the wild, although numbers have decreased locally following destruction of woodlands. The IUCN Red List classifies the Meyer's parrot as Low Risk/Least Concern. The large population, limited pressure from trade and hunting and 6,000,000&#xA0;km&#xB2; home range of the species make these birds unlikely to face extinction in the near future. The trade in Meyer's Parrots that have been bred in aviculture is legal. Meyer's Parrots are listed on Appendix II of the <span>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna</span>. Appendix II listing means the species can also be taken from the wild and traded in 'limited' numbers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pet_parrots">Pet parrots</span></h2>
<p>Meyer's Parrots are commonly bred for the pet trade. They are relatively quiet and small and are able to learn a dozen of words.</p>
