<p>This <span>non-migratory</span> <span>wheatear</span> is resident in mountainous and rocky habitats in <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>South Africa</span> and southernmost <span>Angola</span>.</p>
<p>Mountain wheatear is 18&#x2013;20&#xA0;cm long, and like other wheatears, it has a distinctive tail pattern, with a white rump and outer tail feathers. Its legs and pointed bill are black.</p>
<p>The male is very variable in plumage, although the tail pattern and a white shoulder patch are always present. A white and black bird. The body plumage varies from pale grey to almost black, and it may or may not have a white crown to the head. The female is entirely dark brown apart from the white rump and outer tail.</p>
<p>The Mountain wheatear's song is a clear melodic whistle interspersed with harsh chatters. It is monogamous and nests on the ground amongst rocks, laying 2-4 white eggs. It eats insects and berries.</p>
