<p>The <b>northern wheatear</b> or <b>wheatear</b> (<i>Oenanthe oenanthe</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> that was formerly classed as a member of the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an <span>Old World flycatcher</span>, Muscicapidae. It is the most widespread member of the <span>wheatear</span> genus <i>Oenanthe</i> in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The northern wheatear is a <span>migratory</span> insectivorous species breeding in open stony country in <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span> with footholds in northeastern <span>Canada</span> and <span>Greenland</span> as well as in northwestern Canada and <span>Alaska</span>. It nests in rock crevices and <span>rabbit</span> burrows. All birds winter in <span>Africa</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i>Systema naturae</i> in 1758 as <i>Motacilla oenanthe</i>. The generic name, <i>Oenanthe</i>, is also the name of a <span>plant</span> genus, the <span>water dropworts</span>, and is derived from the Greek <i>ainos</i> "wine" and <i>anthos</i> "flower", from the wine-like scent of the flowers. In the case of the wheatear, it refers to these birds' return to Greece in the spring just as the <span>grapevines</span> blossom.</p>
<p>Its <span>English</span> name has nothing to do with <span>wheat</span> or <span>ears</span>, but is an altered (perhaps <span>bowdlerised</span>) form of <b>white-arse</b>, which refers to its prominent white rump.</p>
<p>The following are the subspecies of northern wheatear:</p>

<p>The northern wheatear is larger than the <span>European Robin</span> at 14&#xBD;&#x2013;16&#xA0;cm length. Both sexes have a white rump and tail, with a black inverted T-pattern at the end of the tail.</p>
<p>The <span>plumage</span> of the summer male has grey upperparts, buff throat and black wings and face mask. In autumn it resembles the female apart from the black wings. The female is pale brown above and buff below with darker brown wings. The male has a whistling, crackly <span>song</span>. Its call is a typical chat <i>chack</i> noise.</p>

<p>The northern wheatear makes one of the longest journeys of any small bird, crossing ocean, ice, and desert. It migrates from Sub-Saharan Africa in Spring over a vast area of the northern hemisphere that includes northern and central Asia, Europe, Greenland, Alaska, and parts of Canada. In Autumn all return to Africa, where their ancestors had wintered. Arguably, some of the birds that breed in north Asia could take a shorter route and winter in south Asia; however, their inherited inclination to migrate takes them back to Africa.</p>
<p>Birds of the large, bright Greenland race, <i>leucorhoa</i>, makes one of the longest transoceanic crossings of any passerine. In spring most migrate along a route (commonly used by <span>waders</span> and <span>waterfowl</span>) from Africa via continental Europe, the British Isles, and Iceland to Greenland. However, autumn sightings from ships suggest that some birds cross the North Atlantic directly from Canada and Greenland to southwest Europe (a distance of up to 2500&#xA0;km). Birds breeding in eastern <span>Canada</span> are thought to fly from <span>Baffin Island</span> and <span>Newfoundland</span> via Greenland, Ireland, and Portugal to the <span>Azores</span> (crossing 3500&#xA0;km of the North Atlantic) before flying onwards to Africa. Other populations from western Canada and <span>Alaska</span> migrate by flying over much of Eurasia to Africa.</p>
<p>Miniature tracking devices have recently shown that the northern wheatear has one of the longest migratory flights known - 30,000&#xA0;km (18,640 miles), from sub-Saharan Africa to their Arctic breeding grounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Alaskan birds travelled almost 15,000km (9,000 miles) each way - crossing Siberia and the Arabian Desert, and travelling, on average, 290km per day. "This is the longest recorded migration for a songbird as far as we know," said Dr Schmaljohann.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>The northern wheatear has an extensive range, estimated at 2.3&#xA0;million&#xA0;square kilometres (0.87&#xA0;million square miles), and a large population estimated at 2.9 million individuals in the Old World and the Americas combined. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span>.</p>
