<p>The <b>black-headed gonolek</b> (<i>Laniarius erythrogaster</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Malaconotidae</span> family. It is found in <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Central African Republic</span>, <span>Chad</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Eritrea</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and <span>Uganda</span>.</p>
<p>Its natural <span>habitats</span> are dry <span>savanna</span>, subtropical or tropical moist <span>shrubland</span>, and subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland <span>grassland</span>.</p>
<p>The black-headed gonolek is a distinctively coloured bush-shrike though it is generally shy and retiring. However, close to human habitation and in gardens, it often becomes much bolder. It has a very distinctive call which it makes in concert with its partner. The male makes a loud, clear, bell-like sound to which the female responds almost simultaneously with a harsh grating response.</p>
