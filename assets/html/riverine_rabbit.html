<p>The <b>riverine rabbit</b> (<i>Bunolagus monticularis</i>), also known as the <b>bushman rabbit</b> or <b>bushman hare</b>, is one of the rarest and most endangered <span>mammals</span> in the world, with probably no more than 400 individuals left. This <span>rabbit</span> has an extremely limited distribution area, found only in the central and southern regions of the <span>Karoo Desert</span> of <span>South Africa</span>'s <span>Cape Province</span>. It is the <span>only member</span> of the genus <i><b>Bunolagus</b></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>It typically has a black stripe running from the corner of the mouth over the cheek. It has a brown woolly tail, cream-colored fur on its belly and throat, and a broad, club-like hind foot. Its tail is pale brown with a tinge of black toward the tip. It is a <span>nocturnal</span> species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is nowadays found in only a few places in the Karoo, none of them being a protected area. <span>Fraserburg</span>, <span>Sutherland</span> and <span>Victoria West</span> all have small populations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Riverine rabbits feed on their favourite foods, the <span>boegoe</span> bush and ink bush at night, and rest up in forms during the day. A form is a shallow scrape made in the soil under a bush. Two types of droppings are produced. At night, when the rabbit is active, hard pellets are deposited. During the day droppings are soft, taken directly from the anus, and swallowed. In this way the riverine rabbit obtains <span>vitamin B</span>, produced by <span>bacteria</span> in the hind gut, and minerals such as <span>calcium</span> and <span>phosphorus</span> are recycled.</p>
