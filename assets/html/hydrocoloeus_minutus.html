<p>The <b>little gull</b> (<i>Hydrocoloeus minutus</i> or <i>Larus minutus</i>), is a small <span>gull</span> which breeds in northern <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>. It also has small colonies in parts of southern <span>Canada</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering on coasts in western Europe, the <span>Mediterranean</span> and (in small numbers) the northeast <span>USA</span>; in recent years non-breeding birds have summered in western Europe in increasing numbers. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Larus</span></i>. It is the only member of the genus <i><b>Hydrocoloeus</b></i>, although it has been suggested that <span>Ross's gull</span> also should be included in this genus.</p>
<p>This species breeds colonially on freshwater marshes, making a lined nest on the ground amongst vegetation. Normally, 2&#x2013;6 eggs are laid.</p>
<p>This is the smallest gull species, with a length of 25&#x2013;30&#xA0;cm (9.8&#x2013;11.8&#xA0;in), a wingspan of 61&#x2013;78&#xA0;cm (24&#x2013;31&#xA0;in) and a weight of 68&#x2013;162&#xA0;g (2.4&#x2013;5.7&#xA0;oz). It is pale grey in breeding plumage with a black hood, dark underwings and often a pinkish flush on the breast. In winter, the head goes white apart from a darker cap and eye-spot. The bill is thin and black and the legs dark red. The flight on rounded wings is somewhat <span>tern-like</span>.</p>
<p>Young birds have black markings on the head and upperparts, and "W" pattern across the wings. They take three years to reach maturity.</p>
<p>These gulls pick food off the water surface, and will also catch insects in the air like a <span>black tern</span>.</p>
