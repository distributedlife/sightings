<p>The <b>cinnamon-chested bee-eater</b> (<i>Merops oreobates</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Meropidae</span> family. It is found in <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and <span>Uganda</span>.</p>

<p>This bird occurs in upland regions and can be found associated with wooded hillsides and forest edges. It can be distinguished from the somewhat similar <span>Little Bee-eater</span> by its larger size, darker colouring, white cheek patches and the upland habitat where it is found. Its diet consists mainly of honeybees although it also eats moths, butterflies, dragonflies, beetles and other flying insects. It seems to be an adaptable species and able to withstand loss of its forest habitat. It measures 22&#xA0;cm (8.7&#xA0;in) in length and weighs 17&#x2013;38&#xA0;g (0.60&#x2013;1.34&#xA0;oz).</p>
