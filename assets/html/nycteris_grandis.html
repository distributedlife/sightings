<p>The <b>large slit-faced bat</b> (<i>Nycteris grandis</i>) is a species of <span>slit-faced bat</span> with a broad distribution in <span>forest</span> and <span>savanna</span> habitats in west, central, and east Africa. <i>N. marica</i> (Kershaw, 1923), is the available name for the southern savanna species if it is recognized as distinct from this species.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This type of bat is 2.75&#xA0;in (70&#xA0;mm) to 3.75&#xA0;in (95&#xA0;mm) long and weighs less than 2&#xA0;oz (57&#xA0;g) (same for male and female). The name of this species comes from the <span>furrow</span> down its face. The furrow is partially covered by its <span>nose leaf</span> and that&#x2019;s why it appears to be two slits from the eyes to the nostrils. It has a reddish brown to gray fur on the back and upper areas. The torso is pale grey.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>It lives in groups and the colony number may go up to sixty bats. It spends the day taking shelter and roosting in trees, caves or buildings, so it means that it&#x2019;s a nocturnal species. They tend to return to the same <span>roosting spot</span> every day. After feeding they usually groom themselves before approaching others.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>As this species is strong, it preys on other bats, birds, scorpions, <span>sun-spiders</span>, frogs and even grabs fish that are near the surface of the water. It swoops onto its prey.</p>
