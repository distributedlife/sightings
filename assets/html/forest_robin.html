<p>The <b>Forest Robin</b> (<i>Stiphrornis erythrothorax</i>) is a species of bird from <span>Central</span> and <span>West Africa</span>. It is monotypic in the genus <i><b>Stiphrornis</b></i>. It has been placed in the <span>family</span> <span>Turdidae</span>, but is now generally placed in <span>Muscicapidae</span> in the group popularly known as <span>chats</span>. Most taxonomists consider it a single species, but some reviews have recommended recognizing 5 species. It has a total length of around 12&#xA0;cm (4&#xBD; in), has dark upperparts, and a throat and chest that, depending on the exact subspecies, is yellow-orange or deep orange.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The initial split into multiple species within this genus is based on a review from 1999 where it, based on the <span>phylogenetic species concept</span>, was argued that all then recognized <span>taxa</span> should be considered <span>monotypic</span> species. Of these, <i>S. gabonensis</i> and <i>S. xanthogaster</i> were formerly considered subspecies of <i>S. erythrothorax</i>, whereas <i>S. saghensis</i> was described as an entirely new species. The split was not followed in <span>Handbook of the Birds of the World</span>, where it was described as <i>"perhaps premature"</i>. Comparably, the <span>BirdLife</span> Taxonomic Working Group (and consequently <span>IUCN</span>) recommended not following the split, as differences in <span>plumages</span> are relatively small, genetic sampling considered incomplete, and evidence for <span>intergradation</span> or <span>parapatry</span> is lacking. Another species from this <span>complex</span>, <i>S. pyrrholaemus</i>, was <span>described as a new species</span> in 2008. Based on <span>mtDNA</span>, it is placed within <i>S. erythrothorax <span>sensu lato</span></i>, and consequently is only a species (rather than a subspecies of <i>S. erythrothorax</i>) if at least some of the <span>taxonomy</span> recommended in 1999 is followed. The <span>genetic divergence</span> between <i>S. pyrrholaemus</i> and other members of the genus is comparable to that between some other closely related species.</p>
