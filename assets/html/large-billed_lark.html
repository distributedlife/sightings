<p>The <b>Large-billed Lark</b> or <b>Southern Thick-billed Lark</b> (<i>Galerida magnirostris</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. It is a resident breeder in southern <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Lesotho</span> and southernmost <span>Namibia</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_breeding">Habitat and breeding</span></h2>
<p>The natural habitat of Large-billed Lark is <span>fynbos</span>, <span>karoo</span> scrub and mountain grassland. It is also found in cultivated and fallow agricultural land. Like other larks, it nests on the ground. Its food is <span>seeds</span> and <span>insects</span>, the latter especially in the breeding season.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>The Large-billed Lark is 18&#xA0;cm in length. It is relatively short-tailed and has a thick bill with a yellow base to the lower mandible. It has streaked brown-grey upperparts, and a long white <span>supercilium</span>. Like other species in the genus, it has a crest that can be raised in display or alarm. The underparts are cream-coloured with heavy dark streaking on the breast. The heavy bicoloured bill distinguished this species from all other <span>African</span> larks.</p>
<p>The call of this very vocal species is a soft creaking <i>treeeeleeeeleee</i>.</p>
