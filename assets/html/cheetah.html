<p>The <b>cheetah</b> (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i>) is a <span>large feline</span> (family <span>Felidae</span>, subfamily <span>Felinae</span>) inhabiting most of <span>Africa</span> and parts of <span>Iran</span>. It is the <span>only extant member</span> of the genus <i><span>Acinonyx</span></i>. The cheetah can run <span>faster</span> than any other land animal&#x2014; as fast as 112 to 120&#xA0;km/h (70 to 75&#xA0;mph) in short bursts covering distances up to 500&#xA0;m (1,600&#xA0;ft), and has the ability to accelerate from 0 to 100&#xA0;km/h (62&#xA0;mph) in three seconds. This cat is also notable for modifications in the species' paws. It is one of the few felids with semi-<span>retractable claws</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word "cheetah" is derived from the <span>Sanskrit</span> word <i><span title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none">citrak&#x101;ya&#x1E25;</span></i>, meaning "<span>variegated</span>", from the <span>Hindi</span> '&#x91A;&#x940;&#x924;&#x93E;' (<i>c&#x12B;t&#x101;</i>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Genetics.2C_evolution.2C_and_classification">Genetics, evolution, and classification</span></h2>
<p>The <span>genus</span> name, <i>Acinonyx</i>, means "no-move-claw" in <span>Greek</span>, while the <span>species</span> name, <i>jubatus</i>, means "maned" or "crested" in <span>Latin</span>, a reference to the dorsal crest found in cheetah cubs.</p>

<p>The cheetah has unusually low <span>genetic</span> variability. This is accompanied by a very low <span>sperm</span> count, <span>motility</span>, and deformed <span>flagella</span>. Skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs illustrate the former point, in that there is no rejection of the donor skin. It is thought that the species went through a prolonged period of <span>inbreeding</span> following a <span>genetic bottleneck</span> during the <span>last ice age</span>. This suggests that genetic monomorphism did not prevent the cheetah from flourishing across two continents for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The cheetah likely evolved in Africa during the <span>Miocene</span> epoch (26 million to 7.5 million years ago), before migrating to Asia. Recent research has placed the last common ancestor of all existing populations as living in Asia 11 million years ago, which may lead to revision and refinement of existing ideas about cheetah evolution.</p>

<p>The now-extinct species include: <i><span>Acinonyx pardinensis</span></i> (<span>Pliocene</span> epoch), much larger than the modern cheetah and found in <span>Europe</span>, <span>India</span>, and <span>China</span>; <i>Acinonyx intermedius</i> (mid-<span>Pleistocene</span> period), found over the same range. The extinct genus <i><span>Miracinonyx</span></i> was extremely cheetah-like, but recent <span>DNA</span> analysis has shown that <i>Miracinonyx inexpectatus</i>, <i>Miracinonyx studeri</i>, and <i>Miracinonyx trumani</i> (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America and called the "North American cheetah" are not true cheetahs, instead being close relatives to the <span>cougar</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Although many sources list six or more subspecies of cheetah, the taxonomic status of most of these subspecies is unresolved. <i>Acinonyx rex</i>&#x2014;the king cheetah&#x2014;was abandoned as a subspecies after it was discovered that the variation was caused by a single recessive gene. The subspecies <i>Acinonyx jubatus guttatus</i>, the woolly cheetah, may also have been a variation due to a recessive gene. Some of the most commonly recognized subspecies include:</p>

<p>The cheetah's <span>chest</span> is deep and its <span>waist</span> is narrow. The coarse, short fur of the cheetah is tan with round black spots measuring from 2 to 3&#xA0;cm (0.79 to 1.18&#xA0;in) across, affording it some <span>camouflage</span> while hunting. There are no spots on its white underside, but the tail has spots, which merge to form four to six dark rings at the end. The tail usually ends in a bushy white tuft. The cheetah has a small <span>head</span> with high-set eyes. Black "tear marks" running from the corner of its eyes down the sides of the nose to its mouth keep sunlight out of its eyes and aid in hunting and seeing long distances. Its thin and fragile body make it well-suited to short bursts of high speed, but not to long-distance running.</p>
<p>Agility, rather than raw speed, accounts for much of the cheetah's ability to catch prey. Cheetahs can accelerate four times as fast as a human (thanks to greater muscle power) and can slow down by 14 kilometers per hour in one stride. They can hunt successfully in dense forests.</p>
<p>The adult cheetah weighs from 21 to 72&#xA0;kg (46 to 159&#xA0;lb). Its total head-and-body length is from 110 to 150&#xA0;cm (43 to 59&#xA0;in), while the tail can measure 60 to 84&#xA0;cm (24 to 33&#xA0;in) in length. Cheetahs are 66 to 94&#xA0;cm (26 to 37&#xA0;in) tall at the shoulder. Males tend to be slightly larger than females and have slightly bigger heads, but there is not a great variation in cheetah sizes and it is difficult to tell males and females apart by appearance alone. Compared to a similarly sized <span>leopard</span>, the cheetah is generally shorter-bodied, but is longer tailed and taller (it averages about 90&#xA0;cm (35&#xA0;in) tall) and so it appears more streamlined.</p>
<p>Some cheetahs have a rare fur pattern <span>mutation</span> of larger, blotchy, merged spots. Known as "king cheetahs," they were once thought to constitute a separate subspecies but are in fact African cheetahs; their unusual fur pattern is the result of a single recessive gene. The "king cheetah" has only been seen in the wild a handful of times, but it has been bred in captivity.</p>

<p>The cheetah's paws have semi-retractable <span>claws</span> (known only in three other cat species: the <span>fishing cat</span>, the <span>flat-headed cat</span> and the <span>Iriomote cat</span>), offering extra grip in its high-speed pursuits. The <span>ligament</span> structure of the cheetah's claws is the same as those of other cats; it simply lacks the sheath of skin and fur present in other varieties, and therefore, with the exception of the <span>dewclaw</span>, the claws are always visible. The dewclaw is much shorter and straighter than that of other cats.</p>
<p>Adaptations that enable the cheetah to run as fast as it does include large nostrils that allow for increased oxygen intake, and an enlarged heart and lungs that work together to circulate oxygen efficiently. During a typical chase, its respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute. While running, in addition to having good traction due to its semi-retractable claws, the cheetah uses its tail as a rudder-like means of steering to allow it to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank prey animals that often make such turns to escape.</p>
<p>Unlike true big cats of subfamily <i><span>Pantherinae</span></i>, the cheetah can <span>purr</span> as it inhales, but cannot <span>roar</span>. By contrast, the big cats can roar but cannot purr, except while exhaling. The cheetah is still considered by some to be the smallest of the big cats. While it is often mistaken for the leopard, the cheetah does have distinguishing features, such as the aforementioned long "tear-streak" lines that run from the corners of its eyes to its mouth, and spots that are not "rosettes". The thinner body frame of the cheetah is also very different from that of the leopard.</p>

<p>The cheetah is a vulnerable species. Of all the big cats, it is the least able to <span>adapt</span> to new environments. It has always proved difficult to breed in captivity, although recently a few zoos have managed to succeed at this. One technique has been to introduce a dog as a playmate and guard dog to enable a captive cheetah to feel less threatened.</p>
<p>Once widely hunted for its fur, the cheetah now suffers more from the loss of both habitat and prey.</p>
<p>The cheetah was formerly considered to be particularly primitive among the cats and to have evolved approximately 18 million years ago. However, new research suggests the last common ancestor of all 40 existing species of felines lived more recently than about 11 million years ago. The same research indicates that the cheetah, while highly derived morphologically, is not of particularly ancient lineage, having separated from its closest living relatives (<i>Puma concolor</i>, the <span>cougar</span>, and <i>Puma yaguarondi</i>, the <span>jaguarundi</span>) around five million years ago. These felids have not changed appreciably since they first appeared in the <span>fossil record</span>.</p>

A king cheetah showing its distinctive coat pattern</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The king cheetah is a rare mutation of the cheetah characterized by a distinct fur pattern. It was first noted in what was then Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) in 1926. In 1927, the naturalist <span>Reginald Innes Pocock</span> declared it a separate species, but reversed this decision in 1939 due to lack of evidence; but in 1928, a skin purchased by <span>Walter Rothschild</span> was found to be intermediate in pattern between the king cheetah and spotted cheetah and Abel Chapman considered it to be a color form of the spotted cheetah. Twenty-two such skins were found between 1926 and 1974. Since 1927, the king cheetah was reported five more times in the wild. Although strangely marked skins had come from Africa, a live king cheetah was not photographed until 1974 in South Africa's <span>Kruger National Park</span>. <span>Cryptozoologists</span> Paul and Lena Bottriell photographed one during an expedition in 1975. They also managed to obtain stuffed specimens. It appeared larger than a spotted cheetah and its fur had a different texture. There was another wild sighting in 1986&#x2014;the first in seven years. By 1987, thirty-eight specimens had been recorded, many from pelts.</p>
<p>Its species status was resolved in 1981 when king cheetahs were born at the <span>De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre</span> in South Africa. In May 1981, two spotted sisters gave birth there and each litter contained one king cheetah. The sisters had both mated with a wild-caught male from the <span>Transvaal</span> area (where king cheetahs had been recorded). Further king cheetahs were later born at the Centre. It has been known to exist in Zimbabwe, Botswana and in the northern part of South Africa's Transvaal province.</p>
<p>In 2012, the cause of this alternative coat pattern was found to be a mutation in the gene for <i>transmembrane aminopeptidase Q</i> (<i>Taqpep</i>), the same gene responsible for the striped 'mackerel' versus blotchy 'classic' patterning seen in <span>tabby cats</span>. The mutation is <span>recessive</span> and must be inherited from both parents for this pattern to appear, which is one reason why it is so rare.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_color_variations">Other color variations</span></h4>
<p>Other rare color morphs of the species include speckles, <span>melanism</span>, <span>albinism</span> and gray coloration. Most have been reported in Indian cheetahs, particularly in captive specimens kept for hunting.</p>
<p>The <span>Mughal</span> Emperor of India, <span>Jahangir</span>, recorded having a white cheetah presented to him in 1608. In the memoirs of <span>Tuzk-e-Jahangiri</span>, the Emperor, says that in the third year of his reign, "Raja Bir Singh Deo brought a white cheetah to show me. Although other sorts of creatures, both birds and beasts have white varieties&#xA0;... I had never seen a white cheetah. Its spots, which are (usually) black, were of a blue color, and the whiteness of the body also inclined to bluishness." This suggests a <span>chinchilla mutation</span> which restricts the amount of pigment on the hair shaft. Although the spots were formed of black pigment, the less dense pigmentation gives a hazy, grayish effect. As well as Jahangir's white cheetah at Agra, a report of "incipient albinism" has come from Beaufort West according to Guggisberg.</p>
<p>In a letter to "Nature in East Africa", H. F. Stoneham reported a melanistic cheetah (black with ghost markings) in the <span>Trans-Nzoia District</span> of Kenya in 1925. Vesey Fitzgerald saw a melanistic cheetah in Zambia in the company of a spotted cheetah. Red (erythristic) cheetahs have dark tawny spots on a golden background. Cream (isabelline) cheetahs have pale red spots on a pale background. Some desert region cheetahs are unusually pale; probably they are better-camouflaged and therefore better hunters and more likely to breed and pass on their paler colouration. Blue (Maltese or grey) cheetahs have variously been described as white cheetahs with grey-blue spots (chinchilla) or pale grey cheetahs with darker grey spots (Maltese mutation). A cheetah with hardly any spots was shot in Tanzania in 1921 (Pocock); it had only a few spots on the neck and back, and these were unusually small. Another cheetah with this color-morph was photographed in Kenya in 2012.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There are several geographically isolated populations of cheetah, all of which are found in Africa or southwestern Asia. A small population (estimated at about fifty) survive in the <span>Khorasan Province</span> of <span>Iran</span>, where conservationists are taking steps to protect them.</p>
<p>It is possible, though doubtful, that some cheetahs remain in <span>India</span>. There have also been several unconfirmed reports of <span>Asiatic Cheetahs</span> in the <span>Balochistan</span> province of <span>Pakistan</span>, with at least one dead animal being discovered recently.</p>
<p>The cheetah thrives in areas with vast expanses of land where prey is abundant. The cheetah likes to live in an open <span>biotope</span>, such as <span>semidesert</span>, <span>prairie</span>, and thick brush, though it can be found in a variety of habitats. In Namibia, for example, it lives in <span>grasslands</span>, <span>savannahs</span>, areas of dense <span>vegetation</span>, and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>In much of its former range, the cheetah was tamed by <span>aristocrats</span> and used to hunt <span>antelopes</span> in much the same way as is still done with members of the <span>greyhound</span> group of dogs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction_and_behavior">Reproduction and behavior</span></h2>
<p>Females reach maturity in twenty to twenty-four months, and males around twelve months (although they do not usually mate until at least three years old), and mating occurs throughout the year. A study of cheetahs in the <span>Serengeti</span> showed females are sexually promiscuous and often have cubs by many different males.</p>

<p>Females give <span>birth</span> to up to nine cubs after a <span>gestation</span> period of ninety to ninety-eight days, although the average litter size is four. Cubs weigh from 150 to 300&#xA0;g (5.3 to 10.6&#xA0;oz) at birth. Unlike some other cats, the cheetah is born with its characteristic spots. Cubs are also born with a downy underlying fur on their necks, called a <i>mantle</i>, extending to mid-back. This gives them a mane or <span>Mohawk-type</span> appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. It has been speculated this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of the <span>honey badger</span> (ratel), to scare away potential aggressors. Cubs leave their mother between thirteen and twenty months after birth. Life span is up to twelve years in the wild, but up to twenty years in captivity.</p>
<p>Unlike males, females are solitary and tend to avoid each other, though some mother/daughter pairs have been known to be formed for small periods of time. The cheetah has a unique, well-structured <span>social order</span>. Females live alone, except when they are raising cubs and they raise their cubs on their own. The first eighteen months of a cub's life are important; cubs must learn many lessons, because survival depends on knowing how to hunt wild prey species and avoid other predators. At eighteen months, the mother leaves the cubs, who then form a <span>sibling</span> ("sib") group that will stay together for another six months. At about two years, the female siblings leave the group, and the young males remain together for life.</p>

Male cheetah <span>marking his territory</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Males are often social and may group together for life, usually with their brothers in the same litter; although if a cub is the only male in the litter then two or three lone males may form a group, or a lone male may join an existing group. These groups are called <i>coalitions</i>. In one Serengeti, 41% of the adult males were solitary, 40% lived in pairs and 19% lived in trios.</p>
<p>A coalition is six times more likely to obtain an animal territory than a lone male, although studies have shown that coalitions keep their territories just as long as lone males&#x2014; between four to four and a half years.</p>
<p>Males are territorial. Females' home ranges can be very large and a territory including several females' ranges is impossible to defend. Instead, males choose the points at which several of the females' home ranges overlap, creating a much smaller space, which can be properly defended against intruders while maximizing the chance of reproduction. Coalitions will try their best to maintain territories to find females with whom they will mate. The size of the territory also depends on the available resources; depending on the part of <span>Africa</span>, the size of a male's territory can vary greatly from 37 to 160&#xA0;km (14 to 62&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi).</p>
<p><span id="Urine_marking"/> Males <span>mark their territory</span> by urinating on objects that stand out, such as trees, logs, or <span>termite</span> mounds. When male cheetahs urine-mark their territories, they stand less than one meter away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60&#xB0; upward. The whole coalition contributes to the scent. Males will attempt to kill any intruders, and fights result in serious injury or death.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Unlike males and other felines, females do not establish territories. Instead, the area they live in is termed a <i><span>home range</span></i>. These overlap with other females' home ranges, often those of their daughters, mothers, or sisters. Females always hunt alone, although cubs will accompany their mothers to learn to hunt once they reach the age of five to six weeks.</p>
<p>The size of a home range depends entirely on the availability of prey. Cheetahs in southern African <span>woodlands</span> have ranges as small as 34&#xA0;km (13&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi), while in some parts of <span>Namibia</span> they can reach 1,500&#xA0;km (580&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocalizations">Vocalizations</span></h3>
<p>The cheetah cannot roar, but ranks among the more vocal felids. Several sources refer to a wide variety of cheetah vocalizations, but most of these lack a detailed acoustic description which makes it difficult to reliably assess exactly what terms refer to exactly what vocalizations. A short review of the terminology encountered is found in. Some of the vocalizations listed in the literature are:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The cheetah is a <span>carnivore</span>, eating mostly <span>mammals</span> under 40&#xA0;kg (88&#xA0;lb), including the <span>Thomson's gazelle</span>, the <span>Grant's gazelle</span>, the <span>springbok</span> and the <span>impala</span>. The young of larger mammals such as <span>wildebeests</span> and <span>zebras</span> are taken at times, and adults too, when cheetahs hunt in groups. <span>Guineafowl</span> and <span>hares</span> are also prey. While the other big cats often hunt by night, the cheetah is a <span>diurnal</span> hunter. It hunts usually either early in the morning or later in the evening when it is not so hot, but there is still enough light.</p>
<p>The cheetah hunts by <span>vision</span> rather than by <span>scent</span>. Prey is stalked to within 10&#x2013;30&#xA0;m (33&#x2013;98&#xA0;ft), then chased. This is usually over in less than a minute, and if the cheetah fails to make a catch quickly, it will give up. The cheetah has an average hunting success rate of around 50%.</p>
<p>Running at very high speeds puts a great deal of strain on the cheetah's body. When sprinting, the cheetah's <span>body temperature</span> quickly elevates. If it is a hard chase, it sometimes needs to rest for half an hour or more.</p>
<p>The cheetah kills its prey by tripping it during the chase, then biting it on the underside of the throat to suffocate it; the cheetah is not strong enough to break the necks of most prey. The bite may also puncture a vital <span>artery</span> in the neck. Then the cheetah proceeds to devour its catch as quickly as possible before the kill is taken by stronger predators.</p>
<p>Data from 367 runs by three female and two male adults, with an average run distance of 173 m, showed that hunting cheetahs can run 58 miles (93&#xA0;km) per hour. A recent study that followed 5 African cheetahs indicated that cheetahs relied most heavily on acceleration. Most chases involved extreme maneuverability more than speed. The study indicated that cheetahs seemed to rarely run close to 60&#xA0;mph or more; on most hunts they reached 30 to 35&#xA0;mph, but they accelerated and changed direction much more rapidly than any other land animal.</p>
<p>The diet of a cheetah is dependent upon the area in which it lives. For example, on the <span>East African</span> plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle. This small antelope is smaller and slower than the cheetah, which makes it an appropriate prey. Cheetahs look for individuals which have strayed some distance from their group, and do not necessarily seek out old or weak ones.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interspecific_predatory_relationships">Interspecific predatory relationships</span></h3>
<p>Despite their speed and hunting prowess, cheetahs are largely outranked by other large predators in most of their range. Because they have evolved for short bursts of extreme speed at the expense of their power, they cannot defend themselves against most of Africa's other predator species. They usually avoid fighting and will surrender a kill immediately to even a single hyena, rather than risk injury. Because cheetahs rely on their speed to obtain their meals, any injury that slows them down could essentially be life-threatening.</p>
<p>A cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and by eating immediately after the kill. Due to the reduction in habitat in Africa, cheetahs in recent years have faced greater pressure from other native African predators as available range declines.</p>
<p>The cheetah's mortality is very high during the early weeks of its life; up to 90% of cheetah cubs are killed during this time by <span>lions</span>, <span>leopards</span>, <span>hyenas</span>, <span>wild dogs</span>, or even by <span>eagles</span>. Cheetah cubs often hide in thick brush for safety. Mother cheetahs will defend their young and are at times successful in driving predators away from their cubs. Coalitions of male cheetahs can also chase away other predators, depending on the coalition size and the size and number of the predator. Because of its speed, a healthy adult cheetah has few enemies.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_importance">Economic importance</span></h3>
<p>Cheetah fur was formerly regarded as a <span>status symbol</span>. Today, cheetahs have a growing <span>economic</span> importance for <span>ecotourism</span> and they are also found in <span>zoos</span>. <span>White Oak Conservation</span> in <span>Yulee, Florida</span>, which maintains a significant population of cheetahs, has cited that captive management presents challenges because of health, nutrition and socialization of the cats, but that these have been overcome through collaborations among wildlife facilities.</p>
<p>Cheetahs are far less aggressive than other felids and can be tamed, so cubs are sometimes illegally sold as <span>pets</span>.</p>
<p>Cheetahs were formerly, and sometimes still are, hunted because many farmers believe that they eat <span>livestock</span>. When the species came under threat, numerous campaigns were launched to try to educate farmers and encourage them to conserve cheetahs. Recent evidence has shown that cheetahs will not attack and eat livestock if they can avoid doing so, as they prefer their wild prey. However, they have no problem with including farmland as part of their territory, leading to conflict.</p>

</div>
<p><span>Ancient Egyptians</span> often kept cheetahs as pets, and also tamed and trained them for hunting. (But not <span>domesticated</span> i.e., bred under human control.) Cheetahs would be taken to hunting fields in low-sided carts or by horseback, hooded and blindfolded, and kept on leashes while dogs flushed out their prey. When the prey was near enough, the cheetahs would be released and their blindfolds removed. This tradition was passed on to the ancient <span>Persians</span> and brought to India, where the practice was continued by Indian princes into the twentieth century. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance, their use as pets spreading just as their hunting skills were. Other such princes and kings kept them as pets, including <span>Genghis Khan</span> and <span>Charlemagne</span>, who boasted of having kept cheetahs within their palace grounds. <span>Akbar the Great</span>, ruler of the <span>Mughal Empire</span> from 1556 to 1605, kept as many as 1,000 cheetahs. As recently as the 1930s, the <span>Emperor of Ethiopia</span>, <span>Haile Selassie</span>, was often photographed leading a cheetah by a leash. Cheetahs are still tamed in the modern world. One example is Burmani who has been raised in England at Eagle Heights wild animal park from the age of three months. He was bred in a deer park in Germany. He is so tame that he has lost his hunting instinct.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h3>
<p>Cheetah cubs have a high <span>mortality rate</span> due to predation by other carnivores, such as the lion and <span>hyena</span>, and perhaps genetic factors. It has been suggested that the low genetic diversity of cheetahs is a cause of poor sperm, birth defects, cramped teeth, curled tails, and bent limbs. Some biologists even believe that they are too <span>inbred</span> to flourish as a species. Note, however, that they lost most of their genetic diversity thousands of years ago (see the beginning of this article), and yet seem to have only been in decline in the last century or so, suggesting factors other than genetics are mainly responsible.</p>

Approximately 12,400 cheetahs remain in the wild in twenty-five African countries; Namibia has the most, with about 2,500. Another fifty to sixty critically endangered Asiatic cheetahs are thought to remain in Iran. There have been successful breeding programs, including the use of <span>in vitro fertilisation</span>, in zoos around the world.</p>
<p>Founded in <span>Namibia</span> in 1990, the <span>Cheetah Conservation Fund</span>'s mission is to be the world's resource charged with protecting the cheetah and to ensure its future. The organization works with all stakeholders within the cheetah's ecosystem to develop best practices in research, education and ecology and create a sustainable model from which all other species, including people, will benefit.</p>
<p>The South African <span>Cheetah Conservation Foundation</span> has close links and assists in training and sharing program successes with other countries where cheetahs live, including Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Iran and Algeria. The organization's international program includes distributing materials, lending resources and support, and providing training through Africa and the rest of the world.</p>

<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Cheetah reintroduction in India</span></div>
<p>Cheetahs have been known to exist in <span>India</span> for a very long time, but as a result of hunting and other causes, cheetahs have been extinct in India since the 1940s. A captive propagation project has been proposed. <span>Minister of Environment and Forests</span> <span>Jairam Ramesh</span> told the <span>Rajya Sabha</span> on 7 July 2009, "The cheetah is the only animal that has been described extinct in India in the last 100 years. We have to get them from abroad to repopulate the species." He was responding to a call for attention from Rajiv Pratap Rudy of the <span>Bharatiya Janata Party</span> (BJP). "The plan to bring back the cheetah, which fell to indiscriminate <span>hunting</span> and complex factors like a fragile <span>breeding</span> pattern is audacious given the problems besetting tiger conservation." Two naturalists, Divya Bhanusinh and MK Ranjit Singh, suggested importing cheetahs from <span>Africa</span>, after which they will be bred in captivity and, in time, released in the wild.</p>
