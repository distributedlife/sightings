<p><b>Denham's Bustard</b>, <b>Stanley Bustard</b> or <b>Stanley's Bustard</b>, <i>Neotis denhami</i>, is a large <span>bird</span> in the <span>bustard</span> family. It breeds in much of sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>. It is a species of open ground, including agricultural land, grassland, flood-plains and burnt <span>fynbos</span>. It is resident, but some inland populations move to lower altitudes in winter. The common names for this species refer to the English explorer, Major <span>Dixon Denham</span>, and the English naturalist <span>Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby</span>.</p>

<p>Denham's Bustard is the largest species in the <i><span>Neotis</span></i> genus, although is smaller than the bustards in the <i><span>Ardeotis</span></i> genus (as well as the <span>Great Bustard</span>). The male is 9 to 10&#xA0;kg (20 to 22&#xA0;lb) and 100&#x2013;116&#xA0;cm (39&#x2013;46&#xA0;in), the female is much smaller at 3 to 4&#xA0;kg (6.6 to 8.8&#xA0;lb) and 80&#x2013;87&#xA0;cm (31&#x2013;34&#xA0;in). The back is brown, darker and plainer in the male, and the underparts are white. The neck is pale grey with an orange nape. Its grey crown is bordered with black, and a black line runs through the eye with a white line forming an eyebrow above. The long legs are pale yellow. The wings are strikingly patterned in brown, white and black, the male showing more white in flight than the female or young birds. The long legs are yellowish in color and the bill is whitish horn in color.</p>
<p>The male inflates his throat when displaying to show a conspicuous balloon of white feathers. This species is usually silent.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>There are three subspecies of this bustard, all separated in their distribution. <i>N. d. denhami</i> occurs in southwestern <span>Mauritania</span>, <span>Senegal</span> and <span>Gambia</span> then eastwards to <span>Uganda</span> and <span>Ethiopia</span>. <i>N. d. jacksoni</i> is found in <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span> and south to <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Botswana</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span>, with populations also in <span>Angola</span>, and the <span>Democratic Republic of Congo</span>. <i>N. d. stanleyi</i> occurs in <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>. The Denham's Bustard occupies <span>grassland</span> habitats. Mainly they are distributed in <span>savanna</span> and may be found at any elevation up to 3,000&#xA0;m (9,800&#xA0;ft). They can be found in a considerable range of secondary habitats including <span>dense shrubland</span>, <span>light woodland</span>, <span>farmland</span>, <span>dried marsh</span> and <span>arid plains</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Denham's Bustard are often solitary outside of the mating season, although they congregate at large food sources and temporarily band together for migratory movements. Migration is usually in search of food sources and follows passages of rain. This species is <span>omnivorous</span>, feeding on a wide variety of foods as it becomes available to them. Among the diverse foods recorded in the species are <span>insects</span>, small <span>snakes</span>, <span>rodents</span>, the nestlings of other <span>birds</span> and various green <span>plant</span> life. They will sometimes follow <span>ungulate</span> species in order to pick <span>dung beetles</span> out of their droppings.</p>
<p>Like all bustards, the male Denham's Bustard performs a courtship display to attract the attention on females, on what is called a <span>lek</span>. During his display, the male puffs up his head and chest and flairs his tail, thus appearing larger, and calls loudly while he struts about. Breeding occurs over varied times of the year, being especially indefined in <span>East Africa</span>. Breeding may brought on by presence of rainfall. The nest consists of a shallow scrape, in which the female lays one or two eggs, which (if they survive) she will raise alone.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>It has suffered population declines through much, if not all, of its range. Countries including <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Nigeria</span> have had a sharp decrease in population. Hunting is the primary cause of declines across the <span>Sahel</span> and <span>West Africa</span>, but in eastern and southern Africa, conversion of grassland to agriculture is a greater threat. In some areas, the conversion of grassland into commercially logged forest has been threat for the species.</p>
