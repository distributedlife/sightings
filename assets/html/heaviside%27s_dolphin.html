<p><b>Haviside's dolphin</b> (<i>Cephalorhynchus heavisidii</i>), or alternatively <b>Heaviside's dolphin</b>, is a small <span>dolphin</span> found off the coast of <span>Namibia</span> and the west coast of <span>South Africa</span>. It is one of four dolphins in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Cephalorhynchus</span></i>&#xA0;&#x2014; the others being the <span>Chilean dolphin</span>, <span>Hector's dolphin</span>, and <span>Commerson's dolphin</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name">Name</span></h2>
<p>Haviside's dolphin, whose binomial name references <i>heavisidii</i>, is actually named after a Captain "Haviside", who brought a specimen from Namibia to the United Kingdom early in the 19th century. However, its name was once misspelled Heaviside, after a prominent surgeon, Captain Heaviside who collected cetacean and other animal species. The latter name stuck and is the most common in the literature. Some authorities, including the <i>Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals</i> and <i>Mammal Species of the World</i> use the originally intended name of Haviside's dolphin.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_and_distribution">Population and distribution</span></h2>
<p>Although sightings of the species are not uncommon off the <span>Skeleton Coast</span> of Namibia, Haviside's dolphins have not been systematically studied by scientists. They have been recorded off the coast of northern Namibia at 17&#xB0;S and as far south as the southern tip of <span>South Africa</span>. Sightings are often recorded from major population centres such as <span>Cape Town</span> and towns such as <span>Walvis Bay</span>. Sightings are likely from <span>Lambert's Bay</span> either from the shore or from boat trips run from the harbour. No estimates of abundance exist.</p>

Haviside's dolphins off Walvis Bay, Namibia</div>

</div>
<p>Haviside's dolphin is a fairly small dolphin, growing to about 1.8&#xA0;m (5&#xA0;ft 11&#xA0;in) in length and weighing up to 75&#xA0;kg. Their size and the bluntness of their heads lead these dolphins to often be mistaken for <span>porpoises</span>. The head is coloured a dark grey. The front half of the upper side and the flanks are a much lighter grey. The <span>dorsal fin</span>, <span>fluke</span> and back half of the back are again a darker grey colour. The underbelly is white, with flashes of white on the flanks below the dorsal fin.</p>
<p>Males reach sexual maturity at about seven to 9 years. Females reach breeding age at the same time. The gestation period is probably 10 months. Mating occurs in spring and summer. Females are believed to calve on average once every three years. The maximum known age of a Haviside's dolphin is 20 years. This relatively short lifespan, coupled with the long calving period, causes a naturally low population growth rate. Therefore, the species is particularly sensitive to being hunted.</p>
<p>Haviside's dolphins are active and social animals. They typically congregate in groups of about five to 10 in number, but sometimes in larger groups. They are able to swim fast. Part of their play and social activity is to jump vertically clear of the water, turn in the air, and fall back into the sea with virtually no splashing or noise.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Heaviside's dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (<span>CMS</span>). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.</p>
<p>Heaviside's dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.</p>
