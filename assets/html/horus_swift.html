<p>The <b>Horus swift</b> (<i>Apus horus</i>) is a small <span>bird</span> in the <span>swift</span> family. It breeds in <span>sub-Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>. It has an extensive continuous distribution from eastern and southern <span>South Africa</span> north to southern <span>Zambia</span> and central <span>Mozambique</span>, and has recently colonised the <span>De Hoop Nature Reserve</span> area of the Western Cape.</p>
<p>It also occurs very discontinuously in much of the rest of the sub-Saharan region, with the <span>Ethiopian</span> mountains and the area from central <span>Kenya</span> into <span>Uganda</span> having large populations. Identification difficulties confuse the limits of this species&#x2019; range.</p>
<p>Birds in South Africa are <span>migratory</span>, wintering further north. Other populations are resident apart from local movements.</p>
<p>The Horus swift breeds in old burrows of <span>bee-eaters</span>, <span>ground woodpeckers</span>, <span>kingfishers</span> and <span>martins</span>, which are typically in natural or artificial sandy banks. The flat nest of vegetation and hair, glued with saliva is built at the end of the tunnel and 1-4 eggs are laid. The eggs are incubated for 28 days to hatching, and the fledging period is about 6 weeks.</p>
<p>This species is not colonial, but the nature of its breeding habitat means that a number of pairs may be scattered through a bee-eater or <span>Banded Martin</span> colony. It feeds at middle levels over adjacent habitats, but avoids large towns.</p>
<p>The Horus swift is 13&#x2013;15&#xA0;cm long and quite bulky. It appears entirely blackish except for a white patch on the chin and a white rump. It has a medium length forked tail. It has a fluttering flight like <span>little swift</span>. Little swift has a square tail, and more extensive white on the rump than Horus, and <span>white-rumped swift</span> has a more deeply forked tail and a narrower white band. The call is a buzzing <i>peeeeooo, peeeeooo</i>.</p>
<p>The paler subspecies <i>A. h. fuscobrunneus</i> of southwestern <span>Angola</span> has a small grey throat patch and a brown rump. The form <i>toulsoni</i> of northwestern Angola and <span>Zimbabwe</span> is a dark morph of nominate <i>A. h. horus</i>, with a dark rump and small throat patch. Both dark forms have sometimes been split as separate species.</p>
<p><span>Horus</span>, whose name this bird commemorates, was the <span>ancient Egyptian</span> god of the sun, son of <span>Osiris</span> and <span>Isis</span>.</p>
