<p>The <b>Bonin white-eye</b> (<i>Apalopteron familiare</i>) or meguro <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x30E1;&#x30B0;&#x30ED;</span>)</span> is a small yellow and grey bird endemic to the <span>Ogasawara Islands</span> (formerly Bonin Islands) of Japan. Until recently it was considered part of the <span>Meliphagidae</span> family of <span>honeyeaters</span> and was called the <b>Bonin honeyeater</b>.</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of the bird is the white rim around the eyes, which is then surrounded by black masking.</p>
<p>Presently its habitat is restricted to <span>Haha-jima</span> Island. Until several years ago it could also be found on <span>Chichi-jima</span> Island. Because of the bird's small range of habitat, its status is listed as <span>Near Threatened</span>.</p>
<p>A subspecies, the <span>Mukojima white-eye</span>, is extinct.</p>
