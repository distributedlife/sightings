<p>The <b>common genet</b> (<i>Genetta genetta</i>), also known as the <b>small-spotted genet</b> or <b>European genet</b>, is a <span>mammal</span> from the order <span>Carnivora</span>, related to <span>civets</span> and <span>linsangs</span>. The most far-ranging of all the fourteen species of <span>genet</span>, it can be found throughout Africa, parts of the <span>Middle East</span>, and in <span>Europe</span> in <span>Spain</span>, <span>Portugal</span>, the <span>Balearic Islands</span>, and parts of France. Small populations exist that may have escaped from captivity in Germany, <span>Belgium</span> and <span>Switzerland</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>A secretive, nocturnal species, the common genet inhabits rocky terrain with caves, dense scrub land, pine forests, and marshland. This handsome, <span>feline</span>-looking animal, has a pale grey and black spotted coat, with a long striped tail. Like all genets, it has a small head, large ears and eyes, and short legs with retractable claws. Males are larger than females, and juveniles are darker grey.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>The common genet has a varied diet, that consists of small mammals, lizards, birds, amphibians, insects and even fruit. The <span>wood mouse</span> (<i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>) is a favourite prey, but genets from the Balearics live chiefly on lizards. As genets are expert climbers, they also prey on <span>red squirrels</span> (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) and <span>dormice</span> (<i>Eliomys quercinus</i>). Genets kill with a bite to the neck, like cats.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Interactions_with_humans">Interactions with humans</span></h2>
<p>This species is sometimes kept as an exotic pet in the U.S.A. and Asia.</p>
<p>Common genets are often kept around because they aid in keeping vermin populations in check, especially in areas where crops can be negatively affected by pests. Common genets sometimes eat poultry and game birds; however, most humans do not consider genets to be a threat. Common genets are also currently in no danger of becoming endangered, as they are listed under least concern on the <span>Red List</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<p>Along with other <span>viverrids</span>, genets are, among living <span>Carnivorans</span>, considered to be the morphologically closest to the extinct common ancestor of the whole order.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h2>
<p>As many as 30 <span>subspecies</span> of the common genet have been named, and many are under debate as to their validity. They include:</p>
