<p>The <b>Olive Bee-eater</b>, (or <b>Madagascar Bee-eater</b>) (<i>Merops superciliosus</i>) is a <span>near passerine</span> <span>bee-eater</span> <span>species</span> in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Merops</span></i>.</p>
<p>The Olive Bee-eater is found in the grassland and coastal mountain forests of <span>East Africa</span> and <span>Madagascar</span>, and an isolated population can be found in coastal <span>Angola</span>. They are partially migratory, and usually breed only in the southern portion of their range, moving north for the <span>dry season</span> in southern Africa. It lays four eggs in a burrow nest at the beginning of the southern African wet season, and the chicks usually hatch at the beginning of December. Unlike most bee-eaters, the species does not practice <span>cooperative breeding</span> and postfledging dependence is only around nineteen days, which is typical of temperate zone passerines and about half that of most Meropidae species.</p>
