<p>The <b>black-throated thrush</b> (<i>Turdus atrogularis</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> bird in the <span>thrush</span> family. It is sometimes regarded as one <span>subspecies</span> of a <span>polytypic</span> <span>species</span>, "dark-throated thrush", <span>red-throated thrush</span> then being the other subspecies. More recent treatments regard the two as separate species.</p>
<p>The black-throated thrush is a <span>migratory</span> <span>Asian</span> species. Its range overlaps with the more easterly-breeding red-throated thrush.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This is a large and distinctive thrush. The male has black from the chin to the breast with a greyish black tail. The upperparts are grey and the underparts are whitish with orange-red underwing coverts. Females and immatures are similar but the black on the throat and breast is replaced with dusky streaking.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Black-throated thrushes breed along the edges of clearings in coniferous or mixed deciduous forest, often in the undergrowth of Siberian Pine <i><span>Pinus sibirica</span></i> or mixed spruce fir forest, especially along watercourses or in swampy areas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>Breeds solitarily or in loose aggregations of pairs in late May through to late July. The nest is made of grasses and thin twigs bound with earth and lined with fine grasses, moss or lichens. The nest is usually placed within 1.5 to 2m of the ground, sometimes on the ground. Otherwise the behaviour is similar to that of the <span>fieldfare</span> <i>T. pilaris</i>. In winter often found in large flocks with other thrushes such as <span>Tickell's thrush</span> <i>T. unicolor</i>, <span>eye-browed thrush</span> <i>T. eunomus</i> and <span>mistle thrush</span> <i>T. viscivorus</i>, on migration often with <span>dusky thrush</span>. Roosts in dense evergreen vegetation. Feeds on the ground on invertebrates and also feeds on various berries, cherries and some seeds.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The breeding range of the black-throated thrush extends from the extreme east of Europe to Western Siberia and north-west <span>Mongolia</span>. The wintering range extends from the <span>Middle East</span>, although uncommon in the <span>Arabian Peninsula</span> to eastern <span>Burma</span>. As a vagrant it has occurred in <span>Japan</span>, <span>Thailand</span>, and <span>Taiwan</span> as well as to most of Europe west of its normal range.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Formerly considered conspecific with the <span>red-throated thrush</span> <i>T. ruficollis</i> but now considered a separate species.</p>
