<p>The <b>common scoter</b> (<i>Melanitta nigra</i>) is a large <span>sea duck</span>, 43&#x2013;54&#xA0;cm in length, which breeds over the far north of <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span> east to the <span>Olenyok River</span>. The American/E Siberian <i>M. americana</i> (<span>black scoter</span>) is sometimes considered a <span>subspecies</span> of <i>M. nigra</i>.</p>
<p>It <span>winters</span> farther south in <span>temperate</span> zones, on the coasts of <span>Europe</span> as far south as <span>Morocco</span>. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off and dive together.</p>
<p>The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or <span>tundra</span>. 6-8 <span>eggs</span> are laid.</p>
<p>It is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. The male is all black with a bulbous bill which shows some yellow coloration around the <span>nostrils</span>. The female is a brown <span>bird</span> with pale cheeks, very similar to female black scoter.</p>
<p>This species can be distinguished from other scoters, apart from black, by the lack of white anywhere on the drake, and the more extensive pale areas on the female.</p>
<p>This species dives for <span>crustaceans</span> and <span>molluscs</span>; it also eats aquatic <span>insects</span> and small <span>fish</span> when on fresh water.</p>
<p>The common scoter is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocalisations">Vocalisations</span></h2>
<p>Black scoter and common scoter have diagnosably distinct vocalisations (Sangster 2009).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="UK_population_and_current_issues">UK population and current issues</span></h2>
<p>Campbell (1977) estimated the wintering population in north-western Europe to be about 130,000, mostly in the <span>Baltic</span> area, and the UK population at about 20,000. There is a marked passage in spring through the Straits of Dover.</p>
<p>In 2003 a previously unknown wintering population of 50,000+ was found on <span>Shell Flat</span> in the north west of <span>England</span> by Cirrus Energy whilst surveying the area for a new <span>wind farm</span> . Due to this development and an <span>oil spill</span> off the coast of Wales, in 1996, questions about the common scoter population have been asked in the UK Parliament .</p>
<p>Although the common scoter is a winter visitor to the UK, there are some breeding pairs in the north of <span>Scotland</span>. The species has been placed on the <span>RSPB</span> conservation Red List because of a greater than fifty percent decline in this UK breeding population. In 1998 the UK Government agreed to a biodiversity action plan (BAP) for the common scoter to increase the breeding population to 100 pairs by 2008 . The Northern Irish population, which had reached a peak of 150-200 pairs in the 1970s, crashed disastrously in the 1990s,and by 2010 there were no confirmed reports of breeding. However, 100 pairs were recorded in the south of Ireland in a 1995 survey.</p>
<p>At the third steering group meeting of the UK Common Scoter Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) the population in the Shell Flat area was put at 16,500 wintering scoter and 5,000 moulting birds, of which 4,000 used the footprint area of the proposed wind farm .</p>
