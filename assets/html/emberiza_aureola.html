Eggs of <i>Emberiza aureola</i> <span>MHNT</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>yellow-breasted bunting</b> (<i>Emberiza aureola</i>) is an <span>Eurasian</span> <span>passerine</span> bird in the <span>bunting</span> <span>family</span> (Emberizidae).</p>
<p>This bird is similar in size to a <span>reed bunting</span>, but longer-billed. The breeding male has bright yellow <span>underparts</span> with black flank streaks, brown <span>upperparts</span>, black face and throat <span>bar</span>, and a pink lower mandible.</p>
<p>The female has a heavily streaked grey-brown back, and less intensely yellow underparts. She has a whitish face with dark crown, eye and cheek stripes. The juvenile is similar, but the background colour of the underparts and face is buff.</p>
<p>The call is a distinctive <i>zick</i>, and the song is a clear <i>tru-tru, tri-tri</i>.</p>
<p>It breeds in north-eastern <span>Europe</span> and across northern <span>Asia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in south-east Asia, <span>India</span>, and southern <span>China</span>. It is a rare but regular wanderer to western Europe.</p>
<p>The yellow-breasted bunting breeds in open scrubby areas, often near water, and is present in <span>Siberia</span>. It lays for to six eggs in a nest on the ground. Its food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds.</p>
<p>It was formerly classified as a <span>near threatened</span> species by the <span>IUCN</span>. But new research has shown it to be rarer than it was believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to <span>vulnerable</span> status in 2008. In 2013, its assessment changed to <span>endangered</span>.</p>
