<p>The <b>White-backed Vulture</b> (<i>Gyps africanus</i>) is an <span>Old World vulture</span> in the family <span>Accipitridae</span>, which also includes <span>eagles</span>, <span>kites</span>, <span>buzzards</span> and <span>hawks</span>. It is closely related to the European <span>Griffon Vulture</span>, <i>G. fulvus</i>. Sometimes it is called <b>African White-backed Vulture</b> to distinguish it from the Oriental White-backed Vulture&#x2014;nowadays usually called <span>White-rumped Vulture</span>&#x2014;to which it was formerly believed to be closely related.</p>
<p>The White-backed Vulture is a typical vulture, with only down feathers on the head and neck, very broad wings and short tail feathers. It has a white neck ruff. The adult&#x2019;s whitish back contrasts with the otherwise dark plumage. Juveniles are largely dark. This is a medium-sized vulture; its body mass is 4.2&#xA0;to 7.2 kilograms (9.3&#x2013;15.9&#xA0;lb), it is 78 to 98&#xA0;cm (31 to 39&#xA0;in) long and has a 1.96 to 2.25&#xA0;m (6 to 7&#xA0;ft) wingspan.</p>
<p>Like other <span>vultures</span> it is a scavenger, feeding mostly from carcasses of <span>animals</span> which it finds by soaring over savannah. It also takes scraps from human habitations. It often moves in flocks. It breeds in trees on the savannah of west and east <span>Africa</span>, laying one egg. The population is mostly resident.</p>
<p>As it is rarer than previously believed, its conservation status was reassessed from Least Concern to Near Threatened in the 2007 <span>IUCN Red List</span>. In 2012 it was further uplisted to <span>Endangered</span>. In 2013 it is further uplisted to <span>Critically Endangered</span>.</p>
