<p>The <b>Stejneger's petrel</b> (<i>Pterodroma longirostris</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>seabird</span> and a member of the <span>gadfly petrels</span>. The bird is 26&#x2013;31&#xA0;cm in size, with a 53&#x2013;66&#xA0;cm wingspan.</p>
<p>This species is highly <span>pelagic</span>, rarely approaching land, except to <span>nest</span> and rear young. It occurs in the Pacific Ocean, nesting in the <span>Juan Fern&#xE1;ndez Islands</span> off <span>Chile</span>. It is a transequatorial migrant, finding its way to subtropical waters off Japan before returning to its nesting sites. It has been reported well off the west coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Stejneger's petrel nests in <span>burrows</span>. It prefers slopes and ridges in areas of dense <span>fern</span> forests. The population of this bird is decreasing due to introduced cats on its breeding islands. It is considered a vulnerable species because of its restricted breeding range.</p>
<p>The common name commemorates the Norwegian ornithologist <span>Leonhard Hess Stejneger</span>.</p>
