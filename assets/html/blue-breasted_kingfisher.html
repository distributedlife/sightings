The flight of the Blue-breasted Kingfisher is rapid and direct. The large bill has a red upper mandible and black lower mandible. The legs are bright red.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults. The call of this noisy kingfisher is a whistled <i>pu-pu-pu-pu-ku-ku-ku-ku</i>.</p>
<p>The Blue-breasted Kingfisher is a species of a variety of well-wooded habitats. It perches quietly in deep shade whilst seeking food. It is territorial but wary. This species mainly hunts large <span>insects</span>, <span>arthropods</span>, <span>fish</span> and <span>frogs</span>, but will also eat the <span>fruit</span> of the <span>Oil Palm</span>.</p>
<p>It has a striking display in which the wings are spread to show the white linings. The nest is a hole in a tree termite nest. A single clutch of two round white eggs is typical.</p>
