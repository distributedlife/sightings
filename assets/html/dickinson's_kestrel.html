<p><b>Dickinson's Kestrel</b> (<i>Falco dickinsoni</i>) is a <span>bird of prey</span> of southern and eastern <span>Africa</span> belonging to the <span>falcon</span> family <span>Falconidae</span>. It is named after John Dickinson, an <span>English</span> physician and missionary who collected the <span>type specimen</span>. It is also known as the <b>White-rumped Kestrel</b>. Its closest relatives are the <span>Grey Kestrel</span> and <span>Banded Kestrel</span> and the three are sometimes placed in the <span>subgenus</span> <i>Dissodectes</i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a fairly small, stocky <span>kestrel</span> with a large, square head. It is 27&#x2013;30&#xA0;cm (11&#x2013;12&#xA0;in) long with a wingspan of 61&#x2013;68&#xA0;cm (24&#x2013;27&#xA0;in) and a weight of 167&#x2013;246&#xA0;g (5.9&#x2013;8.7&#xA0;oz). The female is about 4% larger and 10-20% heavier than the male. The <span>plumage</span> is mostly dark grey with a pale head and rump. The tail is grey with narrow black bars and a broad subterminal band. The underside of the <span>flight feathers</span> are also barred. The <span>cere</span> and feet are yellow and there is bare yellow skin around the eye. The bill is dark grey and the eyes are brown. <span>Juvenile</span> birds are grey-brown with barred flanks and without the paler head and rump. They have a greenish cere and eye-ring.</p>
<p>It is usually silent but has a high-pitched alarm and contact call. At the <span>nest</span>, a soft, mewing call attracts the young for feeding.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_range">Habitat and range</span></h2>
<p>It inhabits <span>savanna</span> and open <span>woodland</span>, particularly swampy areas near water. It is typically associated with <span>palm trees</span> (such as <i><span>Hyphaene</span></i> and <i><span>Borassus</span></i> species) and is also often found near <span>baobab</span> trees. It occurs in <span>coconut</span> plantations in some areas.</p>
<p>Its range covers most of <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, <span>Zambia</span> and <span>Malawi</span> along with north-eastern <span>South Africa</span> (mainly in <span>Kruger National Park</span>), northern <span>Botswana</span>, north-east <span>Namibia</span>, eastern <span>Angola</span>, southern <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> and parts of <span>Tanzania</span>. It is an occasional visitor to <span>Kenya</span>. The total range is about 3,400,000&#xA0;km (1,300,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). It is generally rather scarce but is commoner in some areas such as <span>Zanzibar</span> and <span>Pemba</span> Islands. Loss of palm trees is a potential threat to the species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It usually hunts from a perch and only occasionally hovers. Large <span>insects</span> such as <span>grasshoppers</span> form the bulk of the diet. It also feeds on <span>lizards</span> and <span>amphibians</span> and sometimes birds, <span>bats</span>, <span>rodents</span> and <span>snakes</span>. It is often attracted to grass fires where it preys on fleeing insects and other prey.</p>
<p>The breeding season lasts from July to October in Tanzania and September to December further south. The nest is a simple scrape with no material used. It is sited 2 to 18&#xA0;m (6.6 to 59.1&#xA0;ft) above the ground in the crown of a dead palm or in a hole in a baobab. Sometimes the old nest of a <span>Hamerkop</span> is used. One to four <span>eggs</span> are laid. They are cream-coloured with reddish-brown markings and are <span>incubated</span> by the female for at least 30 days. The young birds <span>fledge</span> after approximately 33 to 35 days.</p>
