<p>The <b>Greater Spotted Eagle</b> (<i>Aquila clanga</i>), occasionally just called the <b>Spotted Eagle</b>, is a large <span>bird of prey</span>. Like all typical <span>eagles</span>, it belongs to the family <span>Accipitridae</span>.</p>
<p/>

Museum specimen of juvenile</div>

<p>The eagle is 59&#x2013;71&#xA0;cm (23&#x2013;28&#xA0;in) in length and has a wingspan of 157&#x2013;179&#xA0;cm (5.15&#x2013;5.87&#xA0;ft). Typical body mass is 1.6&#x2013;2.5&#xA0;kg (3.5&#x2013;5.5&#xA0;lb), with an occasional big female weighing up to 3.2&#xA0;kg (7.1&#xA0;lb).</p>
<p>There is often a less obvious white patch on the upperwings, but a light crescent on the primary <span>remiges</span> is a good field mark. The white V mark on the rump is less clear-cut in adults than in the Lesser Spotted Eagle. The juvenile has white spots all over its wings and lacks a lighter nape patch.</p>
<p>The call is a dog-like <i>yip</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h3>
<p>This medium-sized eagle is very similar in general appearance to its closest relative the <span>Lesser Spotted Eagle</span> (<i>A. pomarina</i>), which shares part of its <span>range</span>. Head and <span>wing coverts</span> are very dark brown and contrast with the generally medium brown <span>plumage</span>; the Lesser Spotted Eagle has a paler head and wing coverts. The head is small for an eagle. The similarities of the Greater Spotted to the Lesser Spotted often results in misidentification as being that species. This is further complicated by occasional <span>hybrids</span> between the two species.</p>
<p>In winter, it occurs in the range of the <span>Indian Spotted Eagle</span> (<i>A. hastata</i>). From this recently validated relative, it can be distinguished by the darker color and lighter eye (not darker than the body plumage at distance, lighter at close range), and in juveniles, the strong spotting. It is also a bit larger &#x2013; though this cannot be reliably estimated in the field &#x2013; and in the winter quarters prefers wetland <span>habitat</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systematics.2C_taxonomy_and_evolution">Systematics, taxonomy and evolution</span></h2>
<p>The typical eagles are often united with the <span>buteos</span> (<i>Buteo</i>), <span>sea eagles</span> (<i>Haliaetus</i>) and other more heavy-set <span>Accipitridae</span>, but they may be less distinct than formerly believed from the more slender <span>accipitrine</span> hawks. The <span>Lesser Spotted Eagle</span> (<i>A. pomarina</i>) is the Greater Spotted Eagle's closest living relative; their common ancestor seems to have diverged around the middle <span>Pliocene</span>, perhaps some 3.6 million years ago (mya), from the ancestors of the <span>Indian Spotted Eagle</span> (<i>A. hastata</i>) that lives across Iran, <span>Pakistan</span> and India. The "proto-Spotted Eagle" probably lived in the general region of <span>Afghanistan</span>, being split into a northern and a southern lineage when both <span>glaciers</span> and <span>deserts</span> advanced in Central Asia as the <span>last ice age</span> began. The northern lineage subsequently separated into the eastern (Greater) and western (Lesser) species of today, probably around the Pliocene-<span>Pleistocene</span> boundary not quite 2 mya.</p>
<p>The spotted eagles are quite distinct as a group from the typical members of <i><span>Aquila</span></i>, the "true eagles". They will probably be included with their putative <span>tropical</span> relatives in <i><span>Lophaetus</span></i> or <i><span>Ictinaetus</span></i>, or moved to a genus of their own in the future.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>This is a species of wooded country. The population is entirely <span>migratory</span>. It breeds from northern <span>Europe</span> eastwards across <span>Asia</span>, and winters in south-eastern Europe, north-eastern Africa, the <span>Middle East</span> and southern Asia. Migration to the breeding grounds takes place fairly late; in <span>Bhutan</span>, for example, birds can be seen with some regularity until the end of March.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Movements">Movements</span></h3>
<p>This species is prone to vagrancy. Its regular breeding range no longer extends as far westwards as <span>Germany</span> but birds are still occasionally seen there with a few records per decade. Even young birds disperse widely; the <span>Staatliches Museum f&#xFC;r Tierkunde Dresden</span> has a specimen (C 21845) shot in November 1914 near <span>Bernsdorf</span> in <span>Saxony</span>. It is a juvenile, and though its exact age cannot be determined it is heavily spotted and probably less than 20 months old.</p>
<p>An adult Greater Spotted was tagged with a satellite transponder in 1993 in order to track <span>migration</span>. The tagged eagle migrated a total of 5,526 kilometers (3,434&#xA0;mi) from its wintering grounds in <span>Yemen</span> to it breeding grounds in western <span>Siberia</span>. It moved 150&#xA0;km (93&#xA0;mi) on average each day, but this increased to 280&#xA0;km (170&#xA0;mi) per day as the bird flew through <span>Mesopotamia</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>In its winter range, the species is more social than when breeding. Small flocks of up to ten birds or so, of varying age, can be seen to patrol the land together. They also associate with other <span>Accipitridae</span> such as local and/or migrant <span>Black Kites</span> (<i>Milvus migrans lineatus</i> and <i>govinda</i>) or <span>Steppe Eagles</span> (<i>A. nipalensis</i>), distinctly smaller and larger raptors, respectively.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The eagele hunts small <span>mammals</span> and similar, mainly terrestrial, prey.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>This eagle lays 1-3 <span>eggs</span> in a tree <span>nest</span>. Generally <span>territorial</span>, juveniles spend some time with their parents after <span>fledging</span>, until they reach <span>sexual maturity</span> and seek out a territory and a mate of their own.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h2>
<p>It is classified as Vulnerable to <span>extinction</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. As of 2000, the world population of this eagle was estimated at less than 4,000 breeding pairs. The primary threats are habit degradation and habitat loss, as well as human disturbance during the mating season.</p>
