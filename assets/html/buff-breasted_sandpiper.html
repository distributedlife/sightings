<p>The <b>buff-breasted sandpiper</b>, <i>Tryngites subruficollis</i>, is a small <span>shorebird</span>. It is a <span>calidrid</span> <span>sandpiper</span> and currently considered to be the <span>only member</span> of the genus <i>Tryngites</i>. Indeed, it probably belongs in the genus <i>Calidris</i> itself, or more precisely with the small species thereof which should be split into a distinct genus (Thomas <i>et al.</i>, 2004). Depending on whether this would include the <span>curlew sandpiper</span> or not, the name <i>Erolia</i> would or would not, respectively, apply.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This species is brown above, and has a buff face and underparts in all plumages. It has a short bill and yellow legs. Males are larger than females. Juveniles resemble the adults, but may be paler on the rear underparts.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p><i>T. subruficollis</i> breeds in the open arctic <span>tundra</span> of <span>North America</span> and is a very long-distance <span>migrant</span>, spending the non-breeding season mainly in <span>South America</span>, especially <span>Argentina</span>.</p>
<p>It <span>migrates</span> mainly through central North America, and is uncommon on the <span>coasts</span>. It occurs as a regular wanderer to western <span>Europe</span>, and is not classed as rare in <span>Great Britain</span> or <span>Ireland</span>, where small flocks have occurred. Only the <span>pectoral sandpiper</span> is a more common American shorebird visitor to <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>This species nests on the ground, laying four <span>eggs</span>. The male has a display which includes raising the wings to display the white undersides, which is also given on migration, sometimes when no other buff-breasted sandpipers are present. Outside the breeding season, this bird is normally found on short-grass <span>habitats</span> such as airfields or golf-courses, rather than near water.</p>
<p>These birds pick up food by sight, mainly eating <span>insects</span> and other <span>invertebrates</span>. They are often very tame.</p>
<p>Buff-breasted sandpipers are <span>suspected</span> to have <span>hybridized</span> with the <span>white-rumped</span> or <span>Baird's sandpiper</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_in_South_Asia_and_Australia">Distribution in South Asia and Australia</span></h3>
<p>This species has been sighted in South Asia on at least three occasions. It is believed that instead of going to Argentina, this bird might have been wind-blown from the Great Plains Flyway of North America and landed up in South Asia. In 2011, November this species was sighted near <span>Kannur</span>, <span>Kerala</span> in South India. The buff-breasted dandpiper has also been recorded from Australia on at least eight occasions.</p>
