<p>The <b>Common mole rat</b>, <i>Cryptomys hottentotus</i>, is a burrowing rodent found in the continent of Africa, specifically in the southwest Cape province, <span>South Africa</span>. It is also found in <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>. The common mole rat belongs to the Bathyerginae family. Bathyerginae is monophyletic, with all taxa tracing back to one common ancestor.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_appearance">Physical appearance</span></h2>
<p>The average body length of a common mole rat is 10.5 to 16.5&#xA0;cm, the tail is 1.2 to 3.8&#xA0;cm. The fur is thick with many different colors, with a distinct white spot on the head. The shape of the body is cylindrical with short appendages. Common mole rats also have chisel-like incisors that are used for digging.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction_and_development">Reproduction and development</span></h2>
<p>Common mole rats are characterized for having one reproductive pair, consisting of the largest female and male in one group. Mating occurs between the months of September and October. During this time, the female raises her tail and allows the mate to smell her genital region. The male then gently chews on her hind region, mounts and mates. The birth of offspring is restricted to the southern hemisphere summer period. The gestation period is about 81 days with 2-5 young per litter. The average age at reproductive maturity is approximately 450 days. Females maintain reproductive function during non-reproductive months.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>Common mole rats are fossorial mammals that can live in a wide range of substrates. They are herbivorous, mainly eating geophytes (plants with underground storage organs) and grass rhizomes. Common mole rats are very widespread, thus their abundance is not well known. This species shows signs of localization due to soil requirements. The pattern of burrowing systems for common mole rats optimizes their access to food, especially gephytes. Burrowing has a negative economic impact in that it damages human property but it is also positive in that it improves soil drainage and turnover.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physiological_attributes">Physiological attributes</span></h2>
<p>Common mole rats are endothermic, having the ability to generate their own heat and keep their body temperature above ambient temperature. They have lower individual body masses in arid environments that help with energy conservation. These mole rats also have long sensory hairs called Vibrissae that stand out from the pelage (fur covering) over their body.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Common mole rats are social creatures that live in family units up to 14 individuals. They showcase eusocial behavior, which involves specialized behavior and cooperative care of the young. Younger mole rats would likely be workers and older mole rats could be casual workers. These workers, for the most part, burrow and forage, with casual workers not working as much as younger workers. The oldest mole rats are breeders.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tunneling">Tunneling</span></h2>
<p>Mole-rats have cylindrical bodies with short limbs to help inside of the tunnels. It has loose skin to fit in small spaces. Can practically somersault within its loose skin. Has hair behind its teeth to prevent dirt and soil from getting inside of the mouth. Loosens soil with teeth then pushes soil underneath its body with forefeet to the hind feet which kick it behind them.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The <i>IUCN Red List</i> lists <i>Cryptomys hottentotus</i> as of Least Concern. Because of their dense and widespread population and their adaptability to pasturelands and rural gardens, their prognosis is a positive one.</p>
