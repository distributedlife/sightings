<p>The <b>scissor-tailed kite</b> or <b>African swallow-tailed kite</b> (<i>Chelictinia riocourii</i>) is the representative of the <span>monotypic</span> genus <i><b>Chelictinia</b></i> in the <span>Accipitridae</span> family. It is widespread in Africa, including: <span>Benin</span>, <span>Burkina Faso</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Central African Republic</span>, <span>Chad</span>, <span>Ivory Coast</span>, <span>Djibouti</span>, <span>Eritrea</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Gambia</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Liberia</span>, <span>Mali</span>, <span>Mauritania</span>, <span>Niger</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Togo</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, and is also found in <span>Yemen</span>.</p>
<p>Although primarily preying on insects and spiders, during the breeding season, it also takes lizards and rodents. It hunts on the wing, by soaring and hovering before to descend to hawk the flying prey or catch it on the ground. This is a gregarious species, sleeping at communal roost at night and hunting in loose flocks. It may also nest in loose colonies. The small stick nest is placed in thick thorny bush. Usually four eggs are laid. This kite performs regular seasonal movements related to the rains.</p>
<p>The species is vulnerable to degradation of the habitat and pesticides. However, populations seem to be locally common in spite of decline in some parts of the range.</p>
