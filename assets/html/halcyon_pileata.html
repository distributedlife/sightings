<p>The <b>black-capped kingfisher</b> (<i>Halcyon pileata</i>) is a <span>tree kingfisher</span> which is widely distributed in tropical <span>Asia</span> from India east to China, <span>Korea</span> and Southeast Asia. This most northerly of the Halcyonidae is resident over much of its range, but northern populations are <span>migratory</span> and the wintering range extends to <span>Sri Lanka</span>, <span>Thailand</span>, <span>Borneo</span> and <span>Java</span>.</p>
<p>This is a large kingfisher, 28&#xA0;cm in length. The adult has a purple-blue back, black head and shoulders, white neck collar and throat, and rufous underparts. The large bill and legs are bright red. In flight, large white patches are visible on the blue and black wings. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are a duller version of the adult. The call of this kingfisher is a cackling <i>ki-ki-ki-ki-ki</i>.</p>
<p>This is a common species on coastal waters especially in mangroves. Although easily disturbed, it perches conspicuously on wires or other exposed perches. This species mainly hunts large insects, but coastal birds will also take fish and frogs. The flight of the black-capped kingfisher is rapid and direct, the short rounded wings whirring.</p>
<p>The nest is a tunnel in an earth bank. A single clutch of 4-5 round white eggs is typical.</p>
