</div>
<p>The <b>killer whale</b> (<i>Orcinus orca</i>), also referred to as the <b>orca whale</b> or <b>orca</b>, and less commonly as the <b>blackfish</b>, is a <span>toothed whale</span> belonging to the <span>oceanic dolphin</span> family. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from the frigid <span>Arctic</span> and <span>Antarctic</span> regions to tropical seas. Killer whales as a species have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt <span>marine mammals</span> like <span>pinnipeds</span>, and even large <span>whales</span>. Killer whales are regarded as <span>apex predators</span>, lacking natural predators.</p>
<p>Killer whales are highly <span>social</span>; some populations are composed of <span>matrilineal</span> family groups which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of <span>culture</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>IUCN</span> currently assesses the orca's <span>conservation status</span> as <span>data deficient</span> because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered <span>threatened</span> or <span>endangered</span> due to prey depletion, <span>habitat loss</span>, pollution (by <span>PCBs</span>), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with <span>fisheries</span>. In late 2005, the "<span>southern resident</span>" population of killer whales that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list.</p>
<p>Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans, but there have been cases of <span>captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers</span> at <span>marine theme parks</span>. Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.</p>

</div>
<p><i><b>Orcinus orca</b></i> is the only recognized <span>extant</span> species in the genus <i>Orcinus</i>, one of many animal species originally described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in 1758 in <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i>. <span>Konrad Gessner</span> wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his "Fish book" of 1558, based on examination of a dead <span>stranded</span> animal in the <span>Bay of Greifswald</span> that had attracted a great deal of local interest.</p>
<p>The killer whale is one of 35 species in the <span>oceanic dolphin family</span>, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has <span>morphological</span> similarities with the <span>pygmy killer whale</span>, the <span>false killer whale</span> and the <span>pilot whales</span>, a study of <span>cytochrome b</span> gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the <span>snubfin dolphins</span> of the genus <i>Orcaella</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_names">Common names</span></h3>
<p>English-speaking scientists most often use the term "killer whale", although the term "orca" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name <i>Orcinus</i> means "of the kingdom of the dead", or "belonging to <span>Orcus</span>". Ancient <span>Romans</span> originally applied <i>orca</i> (plural <i>orcae</i>) to these animals, possibly borrowing it from the Greek <span lang="grc">&#x1F44;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3BE;</span>, which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, orca has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used. The term orca is preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of "killer", and because, being part of the <span>family</span> <span>Delphinidae</span>, the species is more closely related to other dolphins than to whales.</p>
<p>According to some authors, the name <i>killer whale</i> would be a mistranslation of the 18th century Spanish name <i>asesina ballenas</i> which means literally <i>whale killer</i>. <span>Basque whalers</span> would have given it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting their own prey.</p>
<p>They are sometimes referred to as blackfish, a name used for some whale species, as well. <i>Grampus</i> is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of grampus should not be confused with the <i><span>Grampus</span></i> genus, whose only member is <span>Risso's dolphin</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h3>
<p>The three to five types of killer whales may be distinct enough to be considered different <span>races</span>, <span>subspecies</span>, or possibly even <span>species</span>. The <span>IUCN</span> reported in 2008, "The taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely that <i>O. orca</i> will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years." Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different killer whale groups complicate simple differentiation into types, research off the west coast of Canada and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s identified the following three types:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Transients and residents live in the same areas, but avoid each other. The name "transient" originated from the belief that these killer whales were outcasts from larger resident pods. Researchers later discovered transients are not born into resident pods or vice versa. The evolutionary split between the two groups is believed to have begun two million years ago. Genetic data indicate the types have not interbred in the wild for up to 10,000 years.</p>
<p>Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales have been distinguished elsewhere. Separate populations of fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales have been identified around the United Kingdom. As with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating killer whales in <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Norway</span> have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating killer whales in <span>Argentina</span> and the <span>Crozet Islands</span> behave more like transients.</p>
<p>Three types have been documented in the <span>Antarctic</span>. Two dwarf species, named <i>Orcinus nanus</i> and <i>Orcinus glacialis</i>, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.</p>

</div>

<p>Types B and C live close to the ice pack, and <span>diatoms</span> in these waters may be responsible for the yellowish coloring of both types. <span>Mitochondrial DNA</span> sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species. More recently, complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data.</p>
<p>Mammal-eating killer whales were long thought likely to be closely related to other mammal-eating killer whales from different regions, but genetic testing refuted this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The identified seven <i><span>ecotypes</span></i> in isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on <span>minke whales</span>, the second on seals and penguins and the third on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients, should be recognized as distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would enable/require that each new species be subject to separate conservation assessments.</p>

Internal anatomy of an orca</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, and a white patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white. It has a heavy and robust body with a large dorsal fin up to 2&#xA0;m (6.6&#xA0;ft) tall. Behind the fin, it has a dark grey "saddle patch" across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other <span>cetacean</span> species, such as the <span>false killer whale</span> or <span>Risso's dolphin</span>. The killer whale's teeth are very strong and covered in <span>enamel</span>. Its jaws are a powerful gripping apparatus, as the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.</p>
<p>Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26&#xA0;ft) long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons). Females are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7&#xA0;m (16 to 23&#xA0;ft) and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes (3.0 to 3.9 long tons; 3.3 to 4.4 short tons). The largest male killer whale on record was 9.8&#xA0;m (32&#xA0;ft), weighing over 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons), while the largest female was 8.5&#xA0;m (28&#xA0;ft), weighing 7.5 tonnes (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons). Calves at birth weigh about 180&#xA0;kg (400&#xA0;lb) and are about 2.4&#xA0;m (7.9&#xA0;ft) long. The killer whale's large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 56&#xA0;km/h (30&#xA0;kn). The skeleton of the killer whale is of the typical delphinid structure, but is more robust. Its <span>integument</span>, unlike that of most other dolphin species, is characterised by a well-developed dermal layer with a dense network of <span>fascicles</span> of <span>collagen</span> fibers.</p>
<p>Killer whale <span>pectoral fins</span> are large and rounded, resembling paddles. Males have significantly larger pectoral fins than females. At about 1.8&#xA0;m (5.9&#xA0;ft) the male's dorsal fin is more than twice the size of the female's and is more of a triangular shape&#x2014;a tall, elongated isosceles triangle&#x2014;whereas hers is shorter and more curved. Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas. <span>Sexual dimorphism</span> is also apparent in the skull; adult males have longer lower jaws than females, and have larger occipital crests.</p>
<p>An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.</p>
<p>White killer whales occur sporadically but rarely among normal killer whales; they have been spotted in the northern <span>Bering Sea</span> and around <span>St. Lawrence Island</span>, and near the <span>Russian</span> coast. In February 2008, a white killer whale was photographed 3.2&#xA0;km (2.0&#xA0;mi) off <span>Kanaga</span> Volcano in the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>.</p>
<p>Killer whales have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated <span>echolocation</span> abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes.</p>
<p>The mean body temperature of the orca is 36 to 38&#xA0;&#xB0;C (97 to 100&#xA0;&#xB0;F). Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from 7.6 to 10&#xA0;cm (3.0 to 3.9&#xA0;in) thick beneath its skin.</p>
<p>The heart beats at a rate of about 60 beats/min when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.</p>

<p>Female killer whales mature at around age 15. They then have periods of <span>polyestrous</span> cycling with noncycling periods of between three and 16 months. <span>Gestation</span> varies from 15 to 18 months. To avoid inbreeding, males mate with females from other pods. Mothers calve, with usually a single offspring, about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first six to seven months of life, when 37&#x2013;50% of all calves die. <span>Weaning</span> begins at about 12 months and completes by the age of two. According to observations in several regions, all male and female killer whale pod members participate in the care of the young. Killer and pilot whales are two of several species (as is now believed to be widespread among many other mammalian species, including humans) where the females are known to go through <span>menopause</span> and live for decades after they have finished breeding. Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become shorter as they age.</p>
<p>Females breed until age 40, meaning on average they raise five offspring. The lifespans of wild females average 50 years, with a maximum of 80&#x2013;90 years. A female named <span>Granny (J2)</span> is the oldest known orca estimated to be 103 years old.  Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of 50&#x2013;60 years. One male, known as <span>Old Tom</span>, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off <span>New South Wales</span>, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the <span>Pacific Northwest</span> (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010. Captive killer whale lifespans are typically significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, and a few have reached their 40s.</p>

<p>Killer whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their <span>enormous range</span>, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult to compare, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over <span>pelagic</span> environments.</p>
<p>Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of killer whales (&gt;0.40 individuals per 100&#xA0;km&#xB2;) in the northeast Atlantic around the <span>Norwegian</span> coast, in the north Pacific along the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>, the <span>Gulf of Alaska</span> and in the <span>Southern Ocean</span> off much of the coast of <span>Antarctica</span>. They are considered "common" (0.20&#x2013;0.40 individuals per 100&#xA0;km&#xB2;) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of <span>British Columbia</span>, <span>Washington</span> and <span>Oregon</span>, in the North Atlantic Ocean around <span>Iceland</span> and the <span>Faroe Islands</span>. High densities have also been reported but not quantified in the western North Pacific around the <span>Sea of Japan</span> (in very limited areas), <span>Shiretoko Peninsula</span> and off <span>Kushiro</span> (Resident and Transient groups began colonizing in these areas possibly after in 2000s), <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span>, <span>Kuril Islands</span>, <span>Kamchatka</span> and the <span>Commander Islands</span> and in the Southern Hemisphere off the coasts of <span>South Australia</span>, <span>Patagonia</span>, off the coast of southern <span>Brazil</span> and the tip of <span>southern Africa</span>. They are reported as seasonally common in the <span>Canadian Arctic</span>, including <span>Baffin Bay</span> between <span>Greenland</span> and <span>Nunavut</span>, and around <span>Tasmania</span> and <span>Macquarie Island</span>. Information for offshore regions and tropical waters is more scarce, but widespread, if not frequent, sightings indicate the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. They have been sighted, for example, in the <span>Mediterranean</span>, the <span>Arabian</span> Sea, the <span>Gulf of Mexico</span> and the <span>Indian Ocean</span> around the <span>Seychelles</span>. A distinct population may exist in <span>Papua New Guinea</span>.</p>
<p>Probably the largest population lives in Antarctic waters, where they range up to the edge of the <span>pack ice</span> and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open <span>leads</span> much like <span>beluga</span> whales in the Arctic. In contrast, killer whales are seasonal summer visitors to Arctic waters, where they do not approach the ice pack. With the rapid <span>Arctic sea ice</span> decline in the <span>Hudson Strait</span>, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Various areas in coastal <span>New Zealand</span> are home to many friendly, ray-hunting Orcas.</p>
<p>Migration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California. Resident killer whales sometimes travel as much as 160&#xA0;km (100&#xA0;mi) in a day, but may be seen in a general area for a month or more. Resident killer whale pod ranges vary from 320 to 1,300 kilometres (200 to 810&#xA0;mi).</p>
<p>Occasionally, killer whales swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented 100&#xA0;mi (160&#xA0;km) up the <span>Columbia River</span> in the United States. They have also been found in the <span>Fraser River</span> in Canada and the <span>Horikawa River</span> in Japan.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Population">Population</span></h3>
<p>Worldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests an absolute minimum of 50,000. Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250&#x2013;2,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500&#x2013;1,500 off Norway. Japan's Fisheries Agency estimated 2,321 killer whales were in the seas around Japan.</p>

<p>Killer whales are <span>apex predators</span>, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the <span>wolves</span> of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, <span>cephalopods</span>, mammals, <span>sea birds</span> and <span>sea turtles</span>. However, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food. This specialization in diet and hunting, combined with small differences in markings, suggest that they might be different species, rather than populations. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.</p>

<p>Fish-eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the <span>Norwegian</span> and <span>Greenland</span> sea specialize in <span>herring</span> and follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. <span>Salmon</span> account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet. About 65% of them are large, fatty <span>Chinook</span>. <span>Chum salmon</span> are also eaten, but smaller <span>sockeye</span> and <span>pink salmon</span> are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats 227 kilograms (500&#xA0;lb) each day. While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals, herring are often caught using <span>carousel feeding</span>; the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, either stunning or killing up to 10&#x2013;15 fish at a time. The herring are then eaten one at a time. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian killer whale population and with some oceanic dolphin species.</p>
<p>In <span>New Zealand</span>, <span>sharks</span> and <span>rays</span> appear to be important prey; species taken include <span>eagle rays</span>, <span>long-tail</span> and <span>short-tail stingrays</span>, <span>common threshers</span>, <span>smooth hammerheads</span>, <span>blue sharks</span> and <span>shortfin mako sharks</span>. With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are flushed out with bubble-blowing before being cornered and pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce <span>tonic immobility</span> in sharks and rays by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the <span>Farallon Islands</span> in October 1997, a 4.7&#x2013;5.3-metre (15&#x2013;17&#xA0;ft) female killed a 3&#x2013;4-metre (9.8&#x2013;13.1&#xA0;ft) <span>great white shark</span>, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap.</p>
<p>In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an 8-metre (26&#xA0;ft) long <span>whale shark</span>, <i>Rhincodon typus</i>, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in <span>Baja California</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mammals_and_birds">Mammals and birds</span></h3>
<p>Killer whales are very sophisticated and effective predators of <span>marine mammals</span>. Thirty-two <span>cetacean</span> species have been recorded as killer whale prey, from examining either <span>stomach</span> contents, <span>scarring</span> on the prey's body, or feeding activity. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as <span>minke whales</span>, <span>gray whales</span>, and rarely <span>sperm whales</span> or <span>blue whales</span>.</p>
<p>Hunting large whales usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally choose to attack young or weak animals, instead. However, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.</p>

<p>Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of <span>seal</span>, <span>sea lion</span> and <span>fur seal</span>. <span>Walruses</span> and <span>sea otters</span> are less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by <span>head-butting</span> or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>, a decline in <span>sea otter</span> populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in <span>harbour seal</span> and <span>Steller sea lion</span> populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.</p>
<p>In steeply banked beaches off <span>Pen&#xED;nsula Vald&#xE9;s</span>, Argentina, and the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, killer whales feed on <span>South American sea lions</span> and <span>southern elephant seals</span> in shallow water, even <span>beaching</span> temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behavior, and can require years of practice for the young. Killer whales can then release them again near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. "Wave-hunting" killer whales <span>spy-hop</span> to locate <span>Weddell seals</span>, <span>crabeater seals</span>, <span>leopard seals</span>, and <span>penguins</span> resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other killer whales lie in wait.</p>
<p>Killer whales have also been observed preying on <span>terrestrial</span> mammals, such as <span>deer</span> and <span>moose</span> swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale <span>cannibalism</span> has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill <span>porpoises</span> and <span>seals</span> for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Killer whales in many areas may also prey on <span>cormorants</span> and <span>gulls</span>. A captive killer whale at <span>MarineLand</span> discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behavior.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Day-to-day killer whale behavior generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales are frequently active at the surface, engaging in acrobatic behaviors such as <span>breaching</span>, <span>spyhopping</span>, and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging <span>parasites</span>, or <span>play</span>. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.</p>
<p>Resident killer whales swim with <span>porpoises</span>, other <span>dolphins</span>, <span>seals</span>, and <span>sea lions</span>, which are common prey for transient killer whales.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Killer whales are notable for their complex societies. Only <span>elephants</span> and higher <span>primates</span>, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep these animals in captive situations. Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific have a particularly complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These societies are based on <span>matrilines</span> consisting of the <span>matriarch</span> and her descendants which form part of the line, as do their descendants. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals.</p>
<p>Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named <span>Luna</span>, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.</p>
<p>Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. <span>DNA</span> testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods.</p>

<p>Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.</p>
<p>The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.</p>
<p>Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become "rovers" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.</p>

<div class="hatnote boilerplate seealso">See also: <span>Whale sound</span></div>
<p>Like all <span>cetaceans</span>, killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.</p>
<p>Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum <span>salmon</span>, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the <span>marine mammal</span> prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.</p>
<p>All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a <span>dialect</span>. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.</p>
<p>Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.</p>
<p>The vocalizations of killer whales in other parts of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intelligence">Intelligence</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Cetacean intelligence</span></div>
<p>Killer whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after <span>Sperm whales</span>, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be <span>trained</span> in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring "intelligence" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioral strategies are very different from those of humans.</p>

<p>Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.</p>
<p>People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous <span>anecdotes</span> demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from <span>longlines</span>, but also have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn't even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats."</p>
<div class="templatequotecite">&#x2014;Craig Matkin</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.</p>
<p>The killer whale's use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of <span>animal culture</span>.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interspecies_courtships_for_non-feeding_objectives">Interspecies courtships for non-feeding objectives</span></h3>
<p>Fish-feeders are known to interact with other mammals like Sea lions and cetaceans including <span>Fin whales</span>, <span>Minke whales</span>, and <span>Sperm whales</span> to involve no violations. Dolphins and porpoise are occasionally seen traveling with fish eating Killer whales possibly seeking protections from predatory Killer whales. There is an observation of a group of Killer whales seemingly attempts to save an injured <span>Humpback whale</span> off New Zealand coast.</p>

The type C killer whale has two-toned gray colouring, including a dark "dorsal cape", in body areas where most killer whales have solid black colouring. Research is ongoing into whether one or more killer whale types is a distinct species in need of protection.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 2008, the <span>IUCN</span> changed its assessment of the killer whale's <span>conservation status</span> from <span>conservation dependent</span> to <span>data deficient</span>, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered <span>species</span>. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale <span>oil spills</span>, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.</p>
<p>Like other animals at the highest <span>trophic levels</span>, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from accumulation of toxins, including <span>polychlorinated biphenyls</span> (PCBs). European <span>harbour seals</span> have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the <span>Washington</span> coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. Blubber samples in the <span>Norwegian</span> <span>Arctic</span> show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and <span>brominated flame-retardants</span> than in <span>polar bears</span>. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize <span>blubber</span> for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On the west coast of Alaska and the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.</p>

<p>In 2005, the United States government listed the <span>southern resident</span> community as an endangered population under the <span>Endangered Species Act</span>. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the <span>Georgia</span> and <span>Haro Straits</span> and <span>Puget Sound</span> in <span>British Columbia</span> and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in <span>Chinook salmon</span>.</p>
<p>Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located in <span>Friday Harbor</span>, Washington. He was also able to study killer whales from "his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behavior displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" to escape the sound of the sonars. "Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said." The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the exact day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and <span>CAT scans</span> of the two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.</p>
<p>Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the <span>Species at Risk Act</span> in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government in Vancouver, Canada, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the <span>British Columbia Coast</span> and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.</p>

<p>Noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including <span>Johnstone Strait</span> and <span>Haro Strait</span>. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from <span>salmon farms</span> were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the <span>Navy</span> disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with <span>whale watchers</span>, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.</p>
<p>The <span>Exxon Valdez oil spill</span> adversely affected killer whales in <span>Prince William Sound</span> and Alaska's <span>Kenai Fjords</span> region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.</p>

<p>The <span>indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast</span> feature killer whales throughout their history, art, spirituality and religion. The <span>Haida</span> regarded killer whales as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the <span>Kwakwaka'wakw</span>, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with <span>sea lions</span> for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Kwakwaka'wakw and <span>Nuu-chah-nulth</span> mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The <span>Tlingit</span> of southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.</p>
<p>The <span>Maritime Archaic</span> people of <span>Newfoundland</span> also had great respect for killer whales, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial site at the <span>Port au Choix</span> National Historic Site.</p>
<p>In the tales and beliefs of the <span>Siberian Yupik</span> people, killer whales are said to appear as <span>wolves</span> in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small <span>sacrifices</span> such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to allow themselves to be killed.</p>

<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Killer whale attacks on humans</span></div>
<p>In <span>Western cultures</span>, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of a killer whale was given by <span>Pliny the Elder</span> <i>circa</i> AD 70, who wrote, "Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other whales]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming."</p>

<p>Of the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the <span>Terra Nova Expedition</span> was standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen <span>attacks on humans</span> since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.</p>
<p>Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the waters of the <span>Pacific Northwest</span> and <span>Iceland</span>, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in <span>Puget Sound</span> for aquaria through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956.</p>

<div class="hatnote boilerplate seealso">See also: <span>Killer Whales in popular culture</span></div>
<p>Western attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as <span>Moby Doll</span>, a resident harpooned off <span>Saturna Island</span> in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.</p>

</div>
<p>Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in <span>aquaria</span>, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by <span>Michael Bigg</span> led to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother-offspring bonds. Through <span>photo-identification</span> techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.</p>
<p>Bigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.</p>
<p>The public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale&#x2013;keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film <i><span>Free Willy</span></i>, the movie's captive star <span>Keiko</span> was returned to the coast of his native <span>Iceland</span> in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the <span>Earth Island Institute</span>, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. In 2002 the orphan <span>Springer</span> was discovered in <span>Puget Sound</span>, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behavior and social structure of the region's killer whales. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named <span>Luna</span>, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.</p>

<p>The first records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global <span>whaling</span> industry caught immense numbers of <span>baleen</span> and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, <span>Japan</span> took 1,178 killer whales and <span>Norway</span> took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by <span>Soviet</span> whalers, including an <span>Antarctic</span> catch of 916 in 1979&#x2013;80 alone, prompting the <span>International Whaling Commission</span> to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research.Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although <span>Indonesia</span> and <span>Greenland</span> permit small subsistence hunts.</p>
<p>Killer whales have helped humans hunting other whales. One well-known example was in <span>Eden, Australia</span>, including the male known as <span>Old Tom</span>. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as they would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's <span>Prince William Sound</span>, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.</p>

</div>
<p>The killer whale's <span>intelligence</span>, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.</p>
<p>Organizations such as <span>World Animal Protection</span> and the <span>Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society</span> campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the <span>dorsal fin</span> collapse seen in 60&#x2013;90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females which survive infancy live 50 years on average, and up to 70&#x2013;80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 30 years on average, and up to 50&#x2013;60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior. Wild killer whales travel up to 160 kilometres (100&#xA0;mi) each day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of <span>stress</span>. Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known as <span>Tilikum</span> killed three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film, <span>Blackfish</span>. Tilikum has lived at SeaWorld since 1992.</p>
