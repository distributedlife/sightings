<p>The <b>chestnut-throated apalis</b> (<i>Apalis porphyrolaema</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the cisticola family <span>Cisticolidae</span>. The <span>Kabobo apalis</span>, originally described as a distinct species, is usually treated as a <span>subspecies</span> <i>A. p. kaboboensis</i> of the chestnut-throated apalis today. It is itself sometimes considered to be the same species as the <span>Chapin's apalis</span>. The species is found in <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and <span>Uganda</span>, where it is a species of highland forests above 1600 m.</p>
<p>The chestnut-throated apalis is a 12&#xA0;cm long <span>apalis</span> with mostly grey <span>plumage</span>. The nominate subspecies and the subspecies <i>affinis</i> both have chestnut throats, whereas the Kabobo apalis has an entirely grey throat but paler undersides.</p>
<p>The chestnut-throated apalis feeds on insects and other small invertebrates, which are obtained by gleaning from leaves and twigs, hover gleaning and hawking in the air.</p>
