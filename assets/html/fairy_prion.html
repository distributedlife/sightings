<p>The <b>fairy prion</b> (<i>Pachyptila turtur</i>) is a small <span>seabird</span> with the standard <span>prion</span> <span>plumage</span> of black upperparts and white underneath with an "M" wing marking.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The fairy prion is a member of the <span>Pachyptila</span> <span>genus</span>, and along with the <span>blue petrel</span> makes up the <span>prions</span>. They in turn are members of the <span>Procellariidae</span> <span>family</span>, and the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>. The prions are small and typically eat just <span>zooplankton</span>; however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the Albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Pachyptila</i>, the word, comes from the <span>Greek</span> words <i>pakhus</i> and <i>ptilon</i>. <i>Pakhus</i> means <b>thick</b> or <b>stout</b> and <i>ptilon</i> means <b>a feather</b>. Also from the Greek language, <i>prion</i> comes from the word <i>pri&#x14D;n</i> meaning <b>a saw</b>, which is in reference to its serrated edges of its <span>bill</span>.</p>

<p>The fairy prion is the smallest prion and it measures between 23&#x2013;28&#xA0;cm (9.1&#x2013;11.0&#xA0;in) long. Its <span>plumage</span> is blue-grey on its upperparts, and white underneath. They have a dark "M" on their upperparts extending to their wingtips, and their tail is wedge-shaped with a dark tip. They have a blue <span>bill</span> and feet.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The diet consists mainly of planktonic <span>crustaceans</span> and other tiny sea animals, which they feed at night from the water's surface.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>They breed <span>colonially</span> and prefer small islands. The nest is situated in soil, hidden by vegetation and is dug with the bill or feet, or it is in a hollow in a crevice. When coming back to their nest at night, they will coo softly and listen for their mate.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The fairy prion is found throughout oceans and coastal areas in the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span>. Their <span>colonies</span> can be found on <span>Chatham</span>, <span>Snares</span> and <span>Antipodes Islands</span> of <span>New Zealand</span>, <span>Bass Strait</span> Islands of <span>Australia</span>, <span>Falkland Islands</span>, <span>Marion Island</span>, the <span>Crozet Islands</span> and <span>Macquarie Island</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large range, with an estimated population of 5,000,000, the fairy prion is evaluated as Least Concern on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species. Its range is 24,600,000&#xA0;km (9,500,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi).</p>
