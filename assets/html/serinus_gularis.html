<p>The <b>streaky-headed seedeater</b> or <b>streaky-headed canary</b> (<i>Serinus gularis</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>finch</span> <span>family</span>. It is a common resident breeder in suitable habitat in much of <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>.</p>
<p>Its <span>habitat</span> is open woodland and scrub, including <span>savanna</span>, orchards, and gardens. It builds a compact cup nest in a scrub.</p>
<p>The streaky-headed seedeater is 13&#x2013;14&#xA0;cm in length. The adult has brown upperparts with some faint streaking and a plain brown rump. The head has a finely white-streaked crown, dark face, and white <span>supercilium</span> and chin. The underparts are warm buff. The sexes are similar, but some females show a little breast streaking. The juvenile has less head streaking, a dull supercilium, more heavily streaked upperparts, and heavy streaking on the pale grey underparts.</p>
<p>There are nine recognized subspecies, differing mainly in the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts. <i>humilis</i> of the southwestern <span>Cape</span> has almost unstreaked upperparts, and <i>S. g. reichardi</i>, (southern <span>Zaire</span> to southern <span>Tanzania</span> and northern <span>Mozambique</span>) has a distinctly streaked breast even in adult plumage.</p>
<p>The subspecies <i>canicapilla</i> of West Africa is sometimes split as the <b>West African seedeater</b>, <i>Serinus canicapilla</i> (<span>Du Bus de Gisignies</span>, 1855).</p>
<p>The streaky-headed seedeater is usually seen in pairs, but can be gregarious, forming large flocks, alone or with other <span>canary</span> species. It feeds on soft fruit, weed seeds and buds, and sometimes takes insects. Large flocks can damage <span>sunflower</span>, <span>millet</span> and other <span>cereal</span> crops.</p>
<p>This is an unobtrusive finch, often perching inside bushes. Its call is a soft <i>tseee</i>, and the song is a <i>wit-chee-chee-chee-cha cha cha cha chip</i>, interspersed with mimicry of other species. There is also a <i>tweu tweu tirrirrit-tink</i> given in display flight.</p>
