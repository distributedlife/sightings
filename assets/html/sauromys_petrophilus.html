<p><b>Roberts's flat-headed bat</b> (<i>Sauromys petrophilus</i>) is a species of <span>free-tailed bat</span> native to southern Africa. It is the <span>only species</span> in the genus <i>Sauromys</i>. The scientific name translates as "rock loving lizard-mouse", while the common name honours <span>Austin Roberts</span>, who first described the species.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Roberts's flat-headed bat is a moderately sized free-tailed bat, measuring about 10&#xA0;cm (3.9&#xA0;in) in total length, including a 3&#xA0;cm (1.2&#xA0;in) tail, and a wingspan of 25 to 27&#xA0;cm (9.8 to 10.6&#xA0;in). They weigh from 9 to 22&#xA0;g (0.32 to 0.78&#xA0;oz). The body is light grey-brown to dark brown, with creamy-white underparts. The ears are oval in shape, and rise from a common point on the head, unlike those of the closely related genus <i><span>Mormopterus</span></i>. As the common name suggests, the head is unusually flat, without any <span>sagittal crest</span>. The bat can also be distinguished from many other fee-tailed bats by the lack of a scent gland on the throat of males. The wing area has been measured at 81 to 97&#xA0;cm (12.6 to 15.0&#xA0;sq&#xA0;in), with an <span>aspect ratio</span> of 7.6 to 8.3 and a <span>wing loading</span> of about 12 N/m.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Roberts's flat-headed bat is found in southern Africa from far western <span>Mozambique</span> and eastern <span>Zimbabwe</span>, through northern and western <span>South Africa</span> and southern <span>Botswana</span>, to western <span>Namibia</span> and possibly the south-western corner of <span>Angola</span>. Within this region, it inhabits dry <span>savanna</span>, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, and rocky areas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour_and_biology">Behaviour and biology</span></h2>
<p>The bats are nocturnal, and are often caught over water, where they feed primarily on <span>beetles</span>, <span>bugs</span>, and <span>Hymenopteran</span> insects. To a lesser extent, they also feed on soft-bodied insects, such as <span>moths</span>, <span>flies</span>, and <span>Neuropterans</span>. They use <span>frequency modulated</span> narrow band calls with a frequency that ranges from 27 to 44&#xA0;kHz. During the day, they roost in rock crevices. Roosts may harbour up to ten bats, which are often clustered together into smaller, tightly packed groups of up to four individuals each. Pregnant females have been observed in November, but nothing further is known of their reproductive biology and life cycle.</p>
