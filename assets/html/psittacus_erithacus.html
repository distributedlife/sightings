<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>African grey parrots are <span>monogamous</span> breeders which nests in tree cavities. The hen lays 3-5 eggs, which she incubates for 30 days while being fed by her mate. Young leave the nest at the age of 12 weeks. Little is known about the courtship behaviour of this species in the wild.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_and_feeding">Food and feeding</span></h3>
<p>The African grey parrot is primarily a <span>herbivore</span>, feeding on fruit, nuts, leaves, bark and flowers. However it will also eat insects.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats_to_survival">Threats to survival</span></h3>
<p>Humans are by far the largest threat to wild African grey populations. Between 1994 and 2003, over 359,000 African grey parrots were <span>traded</span> on the international market. Mortality amongst imported birds is high. As a result of the extensive harvest of wild birds, in addition to habitat loss, this species is believed to be undergoing a rapid decline in the wild and has therefore been rated as vulnerable by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_to_humans">Relationship to humans</span></h2>
<p>The species is common in captivity and is regularly kept by humans as a <span>companion parrot</span>, prized for its ability to <span>mimic human speech</span>. However, it may be prone to <span>behavioural problems</span> due to its sensitive nature.</p>
