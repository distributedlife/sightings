<p>The <b>common pochard</b> (<i>Aythya ferina</i>) is a medium-sized <span>diving duck</span>.</p>
<p>The adult male has a long dark bill with a grey band, a red head and neck, a black breast, red eyes and a grey back. The adult female has a brown head and body and a narrower grey bill-band. The triangular head shape is distinctive. Pochards are superficially similar to the closely related <span>North American</span> <span>redhead</span> and <span>canvasback</span>.</p>
<p>Females give hoarse growls. Males have whistles cut off by a final nasal note <i>aaoo-oo-haa</i>.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is <span>marshes</span> and lakes with a metre or more water depth. Pochards breed in much of temperate and northern <span>Europe</span> into <span>Asia</span>. They are <span>migratory</span>, and winter in the southern and west of Europe.</p>
<p>These are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks such as <span>tufted duck</span>, with which they are known to hybridise.</p>
<p>These birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants with some <span>molluscs</span>, aquatic <span>insects</span> and small <span>fish</span>. They often feed at night, and will up-end for food as well as the more characteristic diving.</p>

<p>In the <span>British Isles</span>, birds breed in eastern <span>England</span> and lowland <span>Scotland</span>, in small numbers in <span>Northern Ireland</span> with numbers increasing gradually, and sporadically in the Republic of Ireland, where it may also be increasing. Large numbers overwinter in <span>Great Britain</span>, after the birds retreat from <span>Russia</span> and <span>Scandinavia</span>.</p>
<p>The pochard is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
