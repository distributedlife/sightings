<p>The <b>red-backed shrike</b> (<i>Lanius collurio</i>) is a carnivorous <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> and member of the <span>shrike</span> family <span>Laniidae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This 16&#x2013;18&#xA0;cm (approx. 6.3&#x2013;7.1&#xA0;inches) long <span>migratory</span> bird eats large <span>insects</span>, small <span>birds</span>, <span>frogs</span>, <span>rodents</span> and <span>lizards</span>. Like other shrikes it hunts from prominent perches, and impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a "<span>larder</span>." This practice has earned it the nickname of "butcher bird."</p>
<p>The general colour of the male&#x2019;s upper parts is reddish. It has a grey head and a typical shrike black stripe through the eye. Underparts are tinged pink, and the tail has a black and white pattern similar to that of a <span>wheatear</span>. In the female and young birds the upperparts are brown and vermiculated. Underparts are buff and also vermiculated.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>This bird breeds in most of Europe and western Asia and winters in tropical Africa. The bird is listed as a "least concern" (LC) species on a global scale, but some parts of its range have seen a steep decline in numbers, so locally its status can be less secure.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Great_Britain">Great Britain</span></h3>
<p>Once a common migratory visitor to Great Britain, numbers declined sharply during the 20th century. The bird's last stronghold was in <span>Breckland</span> but by 1988 just a single pair remained, successfully raising young at <span>Santon Downham</span>. The following year for the first time no nests were recorded in the UK. But since then sporadic breeding has taken place, mostly in <span>Scotland</span> and <span>Wales</span>. In September 2010 the <span>RSPB</span> announced that a pair had raised chicks at a secret location on <span>Dartmoor</span> where the bird last bred in 1970. In 2011, two pairs nested in the same locality, fledging seven young. In 2012 there was another breeding attempt, this time unsuccessful, probably due to a prolonged spell of wet weather. In 2013 breeding was again confirmed in Devon, with two young fledged at a new site. This return to south western England has been an unexpected development and has raised speculation that a warming climate could assist the bird in re-colonising some of its former haunts, if only in small numbers.</p>
