<p>The <b>Pririt Batis</b> (<i>Batis pririt</i>) also known as the <b>Pririt Puff-back Flycatcher</b> or <b>Pririt Puffback</b>, is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>wattle-eye</span> family. It is resident in western and central southern <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>It is a small stout <span>insect-eating</span> bird, found in dry broadleaf <span>woodland</span> and thorn <span>scrub</span>. The <span>nest</span> is a small neat cup low in a tree or bush.</p>
<p>The Pririt Batis is strikingly patterned. The adult male has a dark grey crown and back, black eye mask and white throat. It has a black rump and tail, and its wing are black with white edging to the <span>flight feathers</span> and a long white shoulder patch. The underparts are white with a broad black breast band and black speckles on the flanks. The female and juvenile <span>plumages</span> differ in that there is no black breast band, but the throat and breast are a warm <span>buff</span> colour.</p>
<p>The Pririt Batis hunts by flycatching, or by taking <span>prey</span> from the ground like a <span>shrike</span>. The <span>song</span> is typically a slow descending series of whistled notes: <i>teuu, teuu, teuu, teuu</i>.</p>
