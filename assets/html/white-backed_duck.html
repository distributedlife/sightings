<p>The <b>white-backed duck</b> (<i>Thalassornis leuconotus</i>) is a <span>waterbird</span> of the family <span>Anatidae</span>. It is distinct from all other ducks, but most closely related to the <span>whistling ducks</span> in the subfamily <span>Dendrocygninae</span>, though also showing some similarities to the <span>stiff-tailed ducks</span> in the subfamily <span>Oxyurinae</span>. It is the only member of the genus <i>Thalassornis</i>.</p>
<p>These <span>birds</span> are well adapted for diving. On occasions they have been observed to stay under water for up to half a minute. They search especially for the bulbs of <span>waterlilies</span>. From danger, they also escape preferentially by diving; hence, the namesake white back is hardly visible in life.</p>
<p>White-backed ducks live in southern Africa, especially between <span>Senegal</span> and <span>Chad</span> in the west and <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>South Africa</span> in the east. Their habitat consists of lakes, ponds, swamps and marshes where they are well camouflaged against predators.</p>
<p>There are two subspecies, <i>Thalassornis leuconotus leuconotus</i> and <i>Thalassornis leuconotus insularis</i>. The latter lives entirely on <span>Madagascar</span> and is considered to be endangered by hunting, habitat loss and the introduction of competing exotic species.</p>
<p>The white-backed duck is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>Woolaver and Nichols (2006) conducted a nesting survey of the Madagascar race in 2001 at Lake Antsamaka in western Madagascar. They found a total of 37, indicating the significance of this single site for the conservation of this insular subspecies. Young, et al. (2006) suggested that an earlier population estimate of 2,500&#x2013;5,000 total birds in Madagascar (Delany &amp; Scott, 2002) may be too optimistic. Its African population may be in the range of 10,000 to 25,000 birds (Kear, 2005)." (Johnsgard, 2010)</p>
