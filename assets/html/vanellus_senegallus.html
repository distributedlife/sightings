<p>The <b>African wattled lapwing</b> or <b>Senegal wattled plover</b> (<i>Vanellus senegallus</i>) is a large <span>lapwing</span>, a group of largish <span>waders</span> in the family <span>Charadriidae</span>. It is a resident breeder in most of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> outside the rainforests, although it has seasonal movements.</p>
<p>These are conspicuous and unmistakable <span>birds</span>. They are large brown waders with a black crown, white forehead and large yellow facial wattles. The tail is white, tipped black, and the long legs are yellow.</p>
<p>In flight, African wattled lapwing's upperwings have black flight feathers and brown coverts separated by a white bar. The underwings are white with black flight feathers. The African wattled lapwing has a loud <i>peep-peep</i> call.</p>
<p>This species is a common breeder in wet lowland habitats, especially damp grassland. It often feeds in drier habitats, such as golf courses, picking <span>insects</span> and other invertebrates from the ground. It lays three or four eggs on a ground scrape.</p>
<p>The African wattled lapwing is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
