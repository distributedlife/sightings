<p>The <b>white-shouldered black tit</b> (<i>Parus guineensis</i>), also known as the <b>white-shouldered tit</b>, is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>tit</span> family. It breeds in a belt across <span>Africa</span> from <span>Senegal</span> in the west to <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Ethiopia</span> in the east. It is sometimes considered conspecific with the more southerly <span>white-winged black tit</span> <i>Parus leucomelas</i> and, like that species, it is mainly black with a white wing patch, but differs in that it has a pale eye.</p>
<p>It is a resident in <span>coniferous</span> woodlands throughout its range, and nests in tree crevice. 4-6 reddish-brown blotched pinkish-white eggs are laid.</p>
