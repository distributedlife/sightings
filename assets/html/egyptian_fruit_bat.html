<p>The <b>Egyptian fruit bat</b> or <b>Egyptian rousette</b> (<i>Rousettus aegyptiacus</i>) is a species of <span>Old World fruit bat</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>Egyptian fruit bat found throughout <span>Africa</span>, except in the desert regions of the <span>Sahara</span>, and throughout the <span>Middle East</span>, as far east as <span>Pakistan</span> and northern <span>India</span>. Due to its extensive geographic range, and relatively large wild population, <i>Rousettus aegyptiacus</i> does not hold any specific conservation status.</p>

<p>The Egyptian fruit bat is small compared to some of its <span>megachiropterid</span> relatives. Its wingspan averages 60&#xA0;cm (2&#xA0;ft), and body length around 15&#xA0;cm (6&#xA0;in). Its weight is typically around 160 g (5.6&#xA0;oz). Males are larger than the females and can be easily distinguished by their large <span>scrotal</span> sack. This bat is typically light brown in color, with darker brown wings. It has large, pointed ears, dark eyes, and a long <span>dog</span>-like muzzle - which sometimes leads it to be referred to as a flying <span>fox</span>. Its fur is very soft, and the wings feel like <span>pantyhose</span>.</p>

<p>Like many bats, Egyptian fruit bats are <span>nocturnal</span>. They spend their days roosting in <span>trees</span> or <span>caves</span>, often with large groups of other bats, sometimes numbering in the thousands. They emerge from the roost to forage for food in the late evening, and return just before dawn. They hang upside down, with their wings folded closely around their bodies. Egyptian fruit bats, along with other <span>species</span> in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Rousettus</span></i>, are the only megachiropterid bats to use <span>echolocation</span>, which they accomplish by emitting a series of sharp clicks with their <span>tongues</span>. The clicks are normally slow and constant, and speed up dramatically when the bats approach an object. They also make use of a range of vocalizations for communication, including grunts and screeches. As a result, a large roosting colony can be a deafening cacophony.</p>

<p>Egyptian fruit bats are <span>frugivorous</span>, consuming large amounts of <span>fruit</span> each night. Wild <span>dates</span> tend to be a favorite, but they will consume almost any soft, pulpy fruit. Most of their diets tends to consist of unripe and insect- and fungus-damaged fruit, which allows them to thrive in habitats where ripe fruit are not available year-round.</p>

<p>Maturity is reached at about nine months of age. Females typically give birth to only a single baby each year, but twins are occasionally born, after a <span>gestation</span> period of around 115&#x2013;120 days. The young are carried by the female until they are able to hang from the roost on their own (after about six weeks), then they are left in the roost while the mother forages for food. Once the baby bat can fly, at about three months of age, it will leave the roost on its own to hunt for its own food. Offspring typically stay with the same colony as the parents for their entire lives.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_captivity">In captivity</span></h2>
<p>The Egyptian fruit bat is well represented in <span>zoos</span> around the world. They breed readily in captivity and easily adapt to a captive diet of more commonly available fruits and <span>nectar</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Concerns">Concerns</span></h2>
<p>These bats, as well as many other fruit-eating bats, are ecologically important because they are <span>pollinators</span> or seed dispersers for many species of trees and plants. The <span>baobab</span> tree, for instance, relies almost exclusively on fruit bats to pollinate its flowers. Unfortunately, fruit bats also eat fruit crops intended for human consumption, so are consequently poisoned or otherwise eliminated by farmers to prevent loss of crops.</p>
<p>The <span>Marburg virus</span> is carried by Egyptian fruit bats in Africa. The Marburg virus is related to Ebola, thus the virus may be carried by an otherwise healthy fruit bat, which may not be readily showing symptoms that negatively affect the bat.</p>
