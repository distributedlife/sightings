<i>Riparia paludicola</i></div>

<p>The <b>brown-throated martin</b> or <b>brown-throated sand martin</b> (<i>Riparia paludicola</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>swallow family</span>. It was first formally described as <i>Hirundo paludicola</i> by <span>French</span> <span>ornithologist</span> <span>Louis Vieillot</span> in 1817 in his <i>Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle</i>. It was formerly regarded as conspecific with the <span>grey-throated martin</span> (<i>R. chinensis</i>) under the name "plain martin".</p>
<p>It has a wide range in <span>Africa</span>. It is a <span>partially migratory</span> species, with some populations making seasonal movements. It is usually associated closely with water.</p>
<p>The brown-throated martin is colonial in its nesting habits, with many pairs breeding close together, according to available space. The nests are at the end of tunnels of 30 to 60&#xA0;cm in length, bored in sandbanks. The actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow. Two to four white eggs are the normal clutch, and are incubated by both parents.</p>
<p>Its brown back, small size and quicker, jerkier flight separate brown-throated martin at once from most other members of the swallow family. It is most similar to the <span>sand martin</span>, <i>Riparia riparia</i> , which is its northern counterpart.</p>
<p>The 12&#xA0;cm long brown-throated martin is brown above and white or pale brown below. It lacks the narrow brown band on the breast shown by the sand martin; the bill is black and the legs are brown. Sexes are similar, but the young have pale tips to the feathers on the rump and wings.</p>
<p>The races differ in size and plumage tones of the upperparts or <span>underparts</span>.</p>

<p>The food of this species consists of small <span>insects</span>, mostly gnats and other flies whose early stages are aquatic.</p>
<p>The twittering song of brown-throated martin is continuous when the birds are on the wing, and becomes a conversational undertone after they have settled in the roost. There is also a harsh alarm call.</p>
