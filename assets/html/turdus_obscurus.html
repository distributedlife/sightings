<p>The <b>eyebrowed thrush</b> (<i>Turdus obscurus</i>) is a member of the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae.</p>
<p>It breeds in dense <span>coniferous</span> forest and <span>taiga</span> eastwards from Siberia. It is strongly <span>migratory</span>, wintering south to southeast <span>Asia</span> and <span>Indonesia</span>. It is a rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>It nests in trees, laying 4-6 <span>eggs</span> in a neat nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form small flocks. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of <span>insects</span>, <span>earthworms</span> and <span>berries</span>.</p>
<p>This is an attractive thrush, with a grey back and head, the latter having a black eyeline, bordered white above and below. The breast and flanks are orange, and the belly white. The sexes are fairly similar, but immatures have a browner back.</p>
<p>The male has a simple whistling song, similar to the related <span>mistle thrush</span>.</p>
<p>In 2007 an eyebrowed thrush was sighted at the <span>Jerusalem Bird Observatory</span> in <span>Jerusalem</span>. This is the second recorded sighting in <span>Israel</span>; the first was at <span>Eilat</span> in October 1996.</p>
<p>In 2011, an eyebrowed thrush was sighted in <span>Australia</span>, near <span>Malanda</span> in <span>Queensland</span>. This is possibly the first confirmed sighting of the species on the Australian mainland.</p>
