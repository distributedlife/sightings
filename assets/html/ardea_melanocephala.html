<p>The <b>black-headed heron</b> (<i>Ardea melanocephala</i>) is a wading bird of the <span>heron</span> family <span>Ardeidae</span>, common throughout much of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> and <span>Madagascar</span>. It is mainly resident, but some west African birds <span>move</span> further north in the rainy season.</p>
<p>This species usually breeds in the <span>wet season</span> in <span>colonies</span> in trees, reedbeds or cliffs. It builds a bulky stick nest, and lays 2&#x2013;4 <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>It often feeds in shallow water, spearing <span>fish</span> or <span>frogs</span> with its long, sharp bill. It will also hunt well away from water, taking large insects, small <span>mammals</span>, and birds. It will wait motionless for its prey, or slowly stalk its victim.</p>
<p>The black-headed heron is a large bird, standing 85&#xA0;cm tall, and it has a 150&#xA0;cm wingspan. It is nearly as large as the <span>grey heron</span>, which it resembles in appearance, although it is generally darker. Its <span>plumage</span> is largely grey above, and paler grey below. It has a powerful dusky bill.</p>

<p>The flight is slow, with the neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and <span>bitterns</span>, and distinguishes them from <span>storks</span>, <span>cranes</span>, and <span>spoonbills</span>, which extend their necks. The white underwing coverts are striking in flight.</p>
<p>The call is a loud croaking.</p>
