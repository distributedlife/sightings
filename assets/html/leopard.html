</div>
<p>The <b>leopard</b> (<i>Panthera pardus</i>) is a member of the <span>Felidae</span> <span>family</span> with a wide range in some parts of <span>Africa</span> and tropical <span>Asia</span>, from <span>Siberia</span>, <span>South</span> and <span>West Asia</span> to across most of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. It is listed as <i><span>Near Threatened</span></i> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> because it is declining in large parts of its range due to <span>habitat loss</span> and fragmentation, and hunting for <span>trade</span> and pest control. It is regionally extinct in <span>Hong Kong</span>, <span>Singapore</span>, <span>Kuwait</span>, <span>Syria</span>, <span>Libya</span> and <span>Tunisia</span>.</p>
<p>The leopard <span class="nowrap"><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA"><span>/</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#x2C8;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>l</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#x25B;</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>p</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>&#x259;r</span></span><span class="IPA nopopups"><span>d</span></span><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA"><span>/</span></span></span> is the smallest of the four "<span>big cats</span>" in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Panthera</span></i>. Compared to other members of the Felidae, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. It is similar in appearance to the <span>jaguar</span>, but is smaller and more slightly built. Its fur is marked with <span>rosettes</span> similar to those of the jaguar, but the leopard's rosettes are smaller and more densely packed, and do not usually have central spots as the jaguars do. Both leopards and jaguars that are <span>melanistic</span> are known as <span>black panthers</span>.</p>
<p>The species' success in the wild is in part due to its <span>opportunistic</span> hunting behavior, its adaptability to habitats, its ability to run at speeds approaching 58 kilometres per hour (36&#xA0;mph), its unequaled ability to climb <span>trees</span> even when carrying a heavy carcass, and its notorious ability for stealth. The leopard consumes virtually any animal that it can hunt down and catch. Its habitat ranges from <span>rainforest</span> to <span>desert terrains</span>.</p>

<p>Leopards show a great diversity in coat color and <span>rosettes</span> patterns. In general, the coat color varies from pale yellow to deep gold or tawny, and is patterned with black rosettes. The head, lower limbs and belly are spotted with solid black. Coat color and patterning are broadly associated with habitat type. Their rosettes are circular in <span>East Africa</span> but tend to be squarer in southern Africa and larger in Asian populations. Their yellow coat tends to be more pale and cream colored in desert populations, more gray in colder climates, and of a darker golden hue in <span>rainforest</span> habitats. Overall, the fur under the belly tends to be lighter coloured and of a softer, downy type. Solid black spots in place of open rosettes are generally seen along the face, limbs and underbelly.</p>
<p>Leopards are agile and stealthy predators. Although they are smaller than other members of the <i>Panthera</i> genus, they are able to take large prey due to their massive skulls that facilitate powerful jaw muscles. Head and body length is usually between 90 and 165&#xA0;cm (35 and 65&#xA0;in). The tail reaches 60 to 110&#xA0;cm (24 to 43&#xA0;in) long, around the same length as the <span>tiger</span>'s tail and relatively the longest tail in the <i>Panthera</i> genus (though <span>snow leopards</span> and the much smaller <span>marbled cats</span> are relatively longer tailed). Shoulder height is from 45 to 80&#xA0;cm (18 to 31&#xA0;in). The muscles attached to the scapula are exceptionally strong, which enhance their ability to climb trees. They are very diverse in size. Males are about 30% larger than females, weighing 30 to 91&#xA0;kg (66 to 201&#xA0;lb) compared to 23 to 60&#xA0;kg (51 to 132&#xA0;lb) for females. Large males of up to 91&#xA0;kg (201&#xA0;lb) have been documented in <span>Kruger National Park</span> in <span>South Africa</span>; however, males in South Africa's coastal mountains average 31&#xA0;kg (68&#xA0;lb) and the females from the desert-edge in <span>Somalia</span> average 23 to 27&#xA0;kg (51 to 60&#xA0;lb). This wide variation in size is thought to result from the quality and availability of prey found in each habitat. The most diminutive leopard subspecies overall is the <span>Arabian leopard</span> (<i>P. p. nimr</i>), from deserts of the <span>Middle East</span>, with adult females of this race weighing as little as 17&#xA0;kg (37&#xA0;lb).</p>
<p>Other large subspecies, in which males weigh up to 91&#xA0;kg (201&#xA0;lb), are the <span>Sri Lankan leopard</span> (<i>P. p. kotiya</i>) and the <span>Anatolian leopard</span> (<i>P. p. tulliana</i>). Such larger leopards tend to be found in areas which lack <span>tigers</span> and <span>lions</span>, thus putting the leopard at the top of the food chain with no competitive restriction from large prey items. The largest verified leopards weighed 96.5&#xA0;kg (213&#xA0;lb) and can reach 190&#xA0;cm (75&#xA0;in) in head-and-body length. Larger sizes have been reported but are generally considered unreliable. The leopard's body is comparatively long, and its legs are short.</p>
<p>Leopards may sometimes be confused with two other large spotted cats, the <span>cheetah</span>, with which it may co-exist in <span>Africa</span>, and the <span>jaguar</span>, a <span>neotropical</span> species that it does not naturally co-exist with. However, the patterns of spots in each are different: the cheetah has simple black spots, evenly spread; the jaguar has small spots inside the polygonal <span>rosettes</span>; while the leopard normally has rounder, smaller rosettes than those of the jaguar. The cheetah has longer legs and a thinner build that makes it look more streamlined and taller but less powerfully built than the leopard. The jaguar is more similar in build to the leopard but is generally larger in size and has a more muscular, bulky appearance.</p>

<p><span>Melanistic</span> leopards are commonly called <span>black panthers</span>, a term that also applies to melanistic <span>jaguars</span>. Pseudomelanism (abundism) also occurs in leopards. Melanism in leopards is inherited as a <span>Mendelian</span>, <span>monogenic</span> <span>recessive trait</span> relative to the spotted form. Pairings of black animals <i>inter se</i> have a significantly smaller litter size than other possible pairings. The black color is caused by <span>recessive</span> <span>gene</span> loci.</p>
<p>The black panther is common in the <span>equatorial rainforest</span> of <span>Malaya</span> and the <span>tropical rainforest</span> on the slopes of some African mountains such as <span>Mount Kenya</span>. Between January 1996 and March 2009, <span>Indochinese leopards</span> were photographed at 16 sites in the <span>Malay Peninsula</span> in a sampling effort of more than 1000 <span>trap</span> nights. Of 445 photographs of melanistic leopards taken, 410 came from study sites south of the <span>Isthmus of Kra</span>, where the non-melanistic morph was never photographed. These data suggest the near fixation of the dark allele in the region. The expected time to fixation of this recessive allele due to <span>genetic drift</span> alone ranged from about 1,100 years to about 100,000 years.</p>
<p>Melanism in leopards has been hypothesized to be causally associated with a selective advantage for ambush.</p>
<p>A rare "Strawberry" leopard has been confirmed to exist at South Africa's Madikwe Game Reserve. It is thought the leopard has <span>erythrism</span>, a little-understood genetic condition that's thought to cause either an overproduction of red pigments or an underproduction of dark pigments</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>In <span>antiquity</span>, a leopard was believed to be a <span>hybrid</span> of a lion and a <span>panther</span>, as is reflected in its name, which is a Greek <span>compound</span> of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x3BB;&#x3AD;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span> <i>le&#x14D;n</i> (lion) and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x3C0;&#x3AC;&#x3C1;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> <i>pardos</i> (male panther). The Greek word is related to <span>Sanskrit</span> <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#x92A;&#x943;&#x926;&#x93E;&#x915;&#x941;</span> <span title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none"><i>p&#x1E5B;d&#x101;ku</i></span> (snake, tiger, panther), and probably derives from a Mediterranean language, such as <span>Egyptian</span>.</p>
<p>A <i>panther</i> can be any of several species of large <span>felids</span>: the term can refer to <span>cougars</span> and <span>jaguars</span> in the American continents but (given the European origins of the word) it is largely thought to define the leopard at its source. <i>Black panther</i> refers to leopards with melanistic genes, which are not uncommon in rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>The generic component of its modern scientific designation, <i>Panthera pardus</i>, derives from Latin via Greek &#x3C0;&#x3AC;&#x3BD;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3C1; (<i>p&#xE1;nth&#x113;r</i>). <span>Folk etymology</span> saw the name as a compound of &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD; (<i>pan</i>, all) and &#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3C1; (beast). However, it is believed instead to be derived from an <span>Indo-Iranian</span> word meaning "white-yellow, pale"; in Sanskrit, this word's reflex was &#x92A;&#x93E;&#x923;&#x94D;&#x921;&#x930; <i>p&#x101;&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ara</i>, which was derived from &#x92A;&#x941;&#x923;&#x94D;&#x921;&#x930;&#x940;&#x915; <i>pu&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;&#xE1;r&#x12B;ka</i> (<i>tiger</i>, among other things), then borrowed into Greek.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_evolution">Taxonomy and evolution</span></h2>
<p>Like all of the feline family, the <i><span>Panthera</span></i> genus has been subject to much alteration and debate, and the exact relations between the four species as well as the <span>clouded leopard</span> and <span>snow leopard</span> have not been effectively resolved.</p>
<p>The leopard was among the first animals named under the modern system of <span>biological classification</span>, since it was described by <span>Carl Linnaeus</span> in 1758 in the <span>10th edition of Systema Naturae</span>. Linnaeus placed the leopard under the genus <i><span>Felis</span></i> as the <span>binominal</span> <i>Felis pardus</i>. In the 18th and 19th centuries, most naturalists and <span>taxonomists</span> followed his example. In 1816, <span>Lorenz Oken</span> proposed a definition of the genus <i>Panthera</i>, with a subgenus Panthera using Linnaeus' <i>Felis pardus</i> as a <span>type species</span>. But most disagreed with his definition, and until the beginning of the 20th century continued using <i>Felis</i> or <i><span>Leopardus</span></i> when describing leopard subspecies. In 1916, <span>Reginald Innes Pocock</span> accorded <i>Panthera</i> generic rank defining <i>Panthera pardus</i> as species.</p>
<p>It is believed that the <span>basal</span> divergence amongst the <span>Felidae</span> family occurred about 11 million years ago. The last common ancestor of the <span>lion</span>, <span>tiger</span>, leopard, <span>jaguar</span>, <span>snow leopard</span>, and clouded leopard is believed to have occurred about 6.37 million years ago. <i>Panthera</i> is believed to have emerged in <span>Asia</span>, with ancestors of the leopard and other cats subsequently migrating into <span>Africa</span>. The researchers suggest that the snow leopard is most closely aligned with the tiger, whereas the leopard possibly has diverged from the <i>Panthera</i> lineage subsequent to these two species, but before the lion and jaguar.</p>
<p>Results of <span>phylogenetic</span> analyses of chemical secretions amongst cats has suggested that the leopard is closely related to the lion. Results of a <span>mitochondrial DNA</span> study carried out later suggest that the leopard is closely related to the snow leopard, which is placed as a fifth <i>Panthera</i> species, <i>Panthera uncia</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fossil_records">Fossil records</span></h3>
<p>Fossils of early leopard ancestors have been found in <span>East Africa</span> and <span>South Asia</span> from the <span>Pleistocene</span> of 2 to 3.5&#xA0;Ma. The modern leopard is suggested to have evolved in Africa 470,000&#x2013;825,000 years ago and radiated across Asia 170,000&#x2013;300,000 years ago.</p>
<p>In Europe, the leopard is known at least since the Pleistocene. <span>Fossil</span> leopard bones and teeth dating from the <span>Pliocene</span> were found in <span>Perrier</span> in <span>France</span>, northeast of <span>London</span>, and in <span>Valdarno</span> in <span>Italy</span>. At 40 sites in <span>Europe</span> fossil bones and dental remains of leopards dating from the <span>Pleistocene</span> were excavated mostly in <span>loess</span> and <span>caves</span>. The sites of these fossil records range from near <span>Lisbon</span>, near <span>Gibraltar</span>, and <span>Santander Province</span> in northern <span>Spain</span> to several sites in France, <span>Switzerland</span>, Italy, <span>Austria</span>, <span>Germany</span>, in the north up to <span>Derby</span> in <span>England</span>, in the east to <span>P&#x159;erov</span> in the <span>Czech Republic</span> and the <span>Baranya</span> in southern <span>Hungary</span>. The Pleistocene leopards of Europe can be divided into four subsequent subspecies. The first European leopard subspecies <i>P. p. begoueni</i> is known since the beginning of the early Pleistocene and was replaced about 600.000 years ago by <i>P. p. sickenbergi</i>, which in turn was replaced by <i>P. p. antiqua</i> at around 300.000 years ago. The last form, the <span>Late Pleistocene Ice Age leopard</span> (<i>P. p. spelaea</i>) appeared at the beginning of the <span>Late Pleistocene</span> and survived until about 24.000 years ago in large parts of Europe.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Leopards have the largest distribution of any wild cat, occurring widely in <span>Africa</span> as well as eastern and southern <span>Asia</span>, although populations have shown a declining trend and are fragmented outside of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. Within sub-Saharan Africa, the species is still numerous and even thriving in marginal habitats where other large cats have disappeared. Populations in <span>North Africa</span> may be <span>extinct</span>. Data on their distribution in <span>Asia</span> are not consistent. Populations in southwest and central Asia are small and fragmented; in the northeast, they are critically endangered. In the <span>Indian subcontinent</span>, <span>Southeast Asia</span>, and <span>China</span>, leopards are still relatively abundant. Of the species as a whole, its numbers are greater than those of other <i>Panthera</i> species, all of which face more acute conservation concerns.</p>
<p>Leopards are exceptionally adaptable, although associated primarily with <span>savanna</span> and <span>rainforest</span>. Populations thrive anywhere in the species range where <span>grasslands</span>, <span>woodlands</span>, and riverine forests remain largely undisturbed. In the <span>Russian Far East</span>, they inhabit <span>temperate forests</span> where winter temperatures reach a low of &#x2212;25&#xA0;&#xB0;C (&#x2212;13&#xA0;&#xB0;F). They are equally adept surviving in some of the world's most humid rainforests and even semi-arid desert edges.</p>
<p>Leopards in west and central Asia try to avoid deserts, areas with long-duration snow cover and areas that are near urban development. In <span>India</span>, leopard populations sometimes live quite close to human settlements and even in semi-developed areas. Although occasionally adaptable to human disturbances, leopards require healthy prey populations and appropriate vegetative cover for hunting for prolonged survival and thus rarely linger in heavily developed areas. Due to the leopard's superlative stealthiness, people often remain unaware that big cats live in nearby areas.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_of_subspecies">Distribution of subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Since <span>Carl Linnaeus</span> published his description of leopards in the <i>Systema Naturae</i> in 1758, as many as 27 leopard subspecies were subsequently described by naturalists from 1794 to 1956. In 1996, according to DNA analysis carried out in the 1990s, only eight subspecies are considered valid. Later analysis revealed a ninth valid subspecies, the <span>Arabian leopard</span> (<i>P. p. nimr</i>). Because of limited sampling of <span>African leopards</span>, this number might be an underestimation.</p>
<p>The nine subspecies recognised by IUCN are:</p>

<p>A morphological analysis of characters of leopard skulls implies the validity of two more subspecies:</p>

<p>Leopards are elusive, solitary and largely <span>nocturnal</span>. They have primarily been studied in open savanna habitats, which may have biased common descriptions. Activity level varies depending on the habitat and the type of prey that they hunt. Radio-tracking and scat analysis in West Africa showed that rainforest leopards are more likely to be <span>diurnal</span> and <span>crepuscular</span>. Forest leopards are also more specialized in prey selection and exhibit seasonal differences in activity patterns.</p>
<p>Leopards are known for their ability in climbing, and have been observed resting on tree branches during the day, dragging their kills up trees and hanging them there, and descending from trees headfirst. They are powerful swimmers, although are not as disposed to swimming as some other big cats, such as the tiger. They are very agile, and can run at over 58 kilometres per hour (36&#xA0;mph), leap over 6 metres (20&#xA0;ft) horizontally, and jump up to 3 metres (9.8&#xA0;ft) vertically. They produce a number of vocalizations, including grunts, roars, growls, meows, and purrs.</p>

<p><span>Home ranges</span> of male leopards vary between 30&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) and 78&#xA0;km (30&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi), and of females between 15 to 16&#xA0;km (5.8 to 6.2&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). Virtually all sources suggest that males do have larger home ranges. There seems to be little or no overlap in <span>territory</span> among males, although overlap exists between the sexes; one radio-collar analysis in the <span>Ivory Coast</span> found a female home range completely enclosed within a male's.</p>
<p>Research in a conservation area in Kenya showed similar territory sizes and sex differential: 32.8&#xA0;km (12.7&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) average ranges for males, and 14&#xA0;km (5.4&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) for females.</p>
<p>In <span>Nepal</span>, somewhat larger male ranges have been found at about 48&#xA0;km (19&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi), while female ranges at 17&#xA0;km (6.6&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi); female home ranges decreased to 5 to 7&#xA0;km (1.9 to 2.7&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) when young cubs were present, while the sexual difference in range size seemed to be in positive proportion to overall increase.</p>
<p>Studies of leopard home range size have tended to focus on protected areas, which may have led to skewed data; as of the mid-1980s, only 13% of the leopard range actually fell within a protected area. However, significant variations in the size of home ranges have been suggested across the leopard's range. Research in Namibia that focused on spatial ecology in farmlands outside of protected areas revealed ranges that were consistently above 100&#xA0;km (39&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) with some more than 300&#xA0;km (120&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). Admitting that their data were at odds with others, the researchers found little or no sexual variation in the size of territories.</p>
<p>Aggressive encounters have been observed. Two of five males studied over a period of a year at a game reserve in South Africa died, both violently. One was initially wounded in a male&#x2013;male territorial battle over a carcass; taken in by researchers, it was released after a successful convalescence only to be killed by a different male a few months later. A second was killed by another predator, possibly a <span>spotted hyena</span>. A third of the five was badly wounded in intraspecific fighting, but recovered.</p>

<p>Leopards are versatile, opportunistic hunters, and have a very broad diet. They feed on a greater diversity of prey than other members of the <i>Panthera</i> genus, and will eat anything from <span>dung beetles</span> to 900&#xA0;kg (2,000&#xA0;lb) male <span>common elands</span>, though prey usually weighs considerably less than 200&#xA0;kg (440&#xA0;lb) . Their diet consists mostly of <span>ungulates</span>, followed by <span>primates</span>, primarily <span>monkeys</span> of various species, including the <span>Vervet monkey</span>. However, they will also opportunistically eat <span>rodents</span>, <span>reptiles</span>, <span>amphibians</span>, <span>insects</span>, <span>birds</span> (especially ground-based types like the <span>Vulturine Guineafowl</span>), <span>fish</span> and sometimes smaller predators (such as <span>foxes</span>, <span>jackals</span>, <span>martens</span> and smaller felid species). In at least one instance, a leopard has predated a sub-adult <span>Nile crocodile</span> that was crossing over land. Leopards are the only natural predators of adult <span>chimpanzees</span> and <span>gorillas</span>, although the cat may sometimes choose to avoid these as they are potentially hazardous prey, especially large male silverback gorillas. They stalk their prey silently, pounce on it at the last minute, and strangle its throat with a quick bite. In Africa, mid-sized <span>antelopes</span> provide a majority of their prey, especially <span>impala</span> and <span>Thomson's gazelles</span>.</p>
<p>In the open savanna of Tsavo National Park, they kill most of their prey while hunting between sunset and sunrise. In Kruger National Park, males and females with cubs are more active at night. At least 92 prey species have been documented in their diet. They focus their hunting activity on locally abundant medium-sized ungulate species in the 20 to 80&#xA0;kg (44 to 176&#xA0;lb) range, while opportunistically taking other prey. Analysis of leopard scats found that 67% contained ungulate remains, of which 60% were impala, the most abundant antelope, with adult weights of 40 to 60&#xA0;kg (88 to 132&#xA0;lb). Small mammal remains were found most often in scats of sub-adult leopards, especially females. Average daily consumption rates was estimated at 3.5&#xA0;kg (7.7&#xA0;lb) for adult males and 2.8&#xA0;kg (6.2&#xA0;lb) for females.</p>

<p>In Asia, the leopard primarily preys on deer such as <span>chitals</span> and <span>muntjacs</span>, as well as various Asian antelopes and <span>ibex</span>. Prey preference estimates in <span>southern India</span> showed that the most favored prey of the leopard were <span>chitals</span>. A study at the <span>Wolong Reserve</span> in China revealed how adaptable their hunting behaviour is. Over the course of seven years, the vegetative cover receded, and the animals opportunistically shifted from primarily consuming <span>tufted deer</span> to pursuing <span>bamboo rats</span> and other smaller prey.</p>
<p>They select their prey focusing on small herds, dense habitat, and low risk of injury, preferring prey weights of 10 to 40&#xA0;kg (22 to 88&#xA0;lb) such as impala, chital, <span>bushbuck</span> and <span>common duiker</span> with an average body weight of 25&#xA0;kg (55&#xA0;lb).</p>
<p>In search of safety, leopards often stash their young or recent kills high up in a tree, which can be a great feat of strength considering that they may be carrying prey heavier than themselves in their mouth while they climb vertically. One leopard was seen to haul a young giraffe, estimated to weigh up to 125&#xA0;kg (276&#xA0;lb), more than twice the weight of the cat, up 5.7&#xA0;m (19&#xA0;ft) into a tree.</p>

<p>Leopards must compete for food and shelter with other large predators such as <span>lions</span>, <span>tigers</span>, <span>spotted hyenas</span>, <span>striped hyena</span>, up to 5 species of <span>bear</span> and both <span>African</span> and <span>Asiatic wild dogs</span>. These animals may steal the leopard's kill, devour its young or even kill adult leopards, although lions are most likely to kill and not eat young leopards if they are discovered. Conflicts over carcasses often end without bloodshed, because leopards will often begrudgingly cede their kills if they encounter a larger-bodied or group-living predator that can potentially kill them. In some areas of Africa, troops of large <span>baboon</span> species (potential leopard prey themselves) will kill and sometimes eat leopard young if they discover them. Occasionally, <span>Nile crocodiles</span> may predate on leopards of any age. Leopards co-exist alongside these other predators by hunting for different types of prey and by avoiding areas frequented by them. Lions are occasionally successful in climbing trees and fetching leopard kills. In the <span>Kalahari</span> desert, leopards frequently lose kills to the <span>brown hyena</span>, if the leopard is unable to move the kill into a tree. Single brown hyenas have been observed charging at and displacing male leopards from kills. <span>Burmese Pythons</span> have been known to prey on leopards, with an adult cat having been recovered from the stomach of an 18-foot specimen.</p>
<p>Resource partitioning occurs where leopards share their range with lions or tigers. Leopards tend to take smaller prey, usually less than 75&#xA0;kg (165&#xA0;lb), where the larger cats are present. In the <span>Chitwan National Park</span> in <span>Nepal</span>, leopards killed prey ranging from less than 25&#xA0;kg (55&#xA0;lb) to 100&#xA0;kg (220&#xA0;lb) in weight with most kills in the 25&#x2013;50&#xA0;kg (55&#x2013;110&#xA0;lb) range; tigers killed more prey in the 50&#x2013;100&#xA0;kg (110&#x2013;220&#xA0;lb) range. In the tropical forests of India&#x2019;s <span>Nagarhole National Park</span>, tigers selected prey weighing more than 176&#xA0;kg (388&#xA0;lb), whereas leopards selected prey in the 30&#x2013;175&#xA0;kg (66&#x2013;386&#xA0;lb) range. The average weights of leopard prey was 37.6&#xA0;kg (83&#xA0;lb), and of tiger prey was 91.5&#xA0;kg (202&#xA0;lb) with a bias towards adult males of <span>chital</span>, <span>sambar</span> and <span>wild pig</span>, and young <span>gaur</span>. In tropical forest they do not always avoid the larger cats by hunting at different times. With relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards seem to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or inter-species dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the leopard's co-existence with the lion in savanna habitats. In areas with high tiger populations, such as in the central parts of India&#x2019;s <span>Kanha National Park</span>, leopards are not permanent residents, but transients. They were common near villages at the periphery of the park and outside the park.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction_and_life_cycle">Reproduction and life cycle</span></h3>
<p>Depending on the region, leopards may mate all year round. In Manchuria and Siberia, they mate during January and February. The <span>estrous cycle</span> lasts about 46&#xA0;days and the female usually is in heat for 6&#x2013;7&#xA0;days. Gestation lasts for 90 to 105 days. Cubs are usually born in a litter of 2&#x2013;4 cubs. But mortality of cubs is estimated at 41&#x2013;50% during the first year.</p>
<p>Females give birth in a cave, crevice among boulders, hollow tree, or thicket to make a den. Cubs are born with closed eyes, which open four to nine days after birth. The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults. Their pelage is also more gray in color with less defined spots. Around three months of age, the young begin to follow the mother on hunts. At one year of age, leopard young can probably fend for themselves, but remain with the mother for 18&#x2013;24&#xA0;months.</p>
<p>The average typical life span of a leopard is between 12 and 17 years. The oldest recorded Leopard was a female named Bertie living in captivity in <span>Warsaw Zoo</span>. She died in December 2010 at the age of 24. The oldest recorded male Leopard was Cezar, who reached the age of 23. He also lived at Warsaw Zoo and was Bertie's lifelong companion.</p>

<p>Crossbreeding between leopards and other members of the genus <i>Panthera</i> has been documented, resulting in <span>hybrids</span>. A cross between a lioness and a male leopard is known as a leopon (or a lipard if the sex of the parents is reversed). Leopons have been bred in captivity; a well-documented case occurred at the Koshien Hanshin Park in <span>Nishinomiya, Japan</span>, in the late 1950s. Although lions and leopards may come into contact in sub-Saharan Africa, they are not widely believed to interbreed naturally. However, there have been anecdotal reports of small lions with exceptionally pronounced spotting, known as "marozis" and various other names, in several African countries, for which there has been cryptozoological speculation that they may be naturally occurring lion-leopard hybrids.</p>
<p>Crossbreeding between jaguars and leopards in captivity has also been documented. A cross between a female leopard and a male jaguar is referred to as a jagupard, the reverse is known a leguar; however, crosses between either have also been called lepjags. Such crosses can only occur in captivity because leopards do not exist in the wild on the American continents where jaguars live. There have also been a few claims of crosses between tigers and leopards.</p>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Pumapard</span></div>
<p>A pumapard is a hybrid animal resulting from a mating between a leopard and a <span>puma</span> (a member of the <i>Puma</i> genus, not the <i>Panthera</i> genus). Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by <span>Carl Hagenbeck</span> at his animal park in <span>Hamburg, Germany</span>. While most of these animals did not reach adulthood, one of these was purchased in 1898 by the <span>Berlin Zoo</span>. A similar hybrid in the Berlin Zoo purchased from Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma. A specimen in the <span>Hamburg Zoo</span> (in the photo at right) was the reverse pairing, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess.</p>
<p>Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard, or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or faded rosettes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leopards_and_humans">Leopards and humans</span></h2>
<p>Leopards have been known to humans throughout history, and have featured in the art, mythology, and folklore of many countries where they have historically occurred, such as <span>ancient Greece</span>, <span>Persia</span>, and Rome, as well as some where they have not existed for several millennia, such as <span>England</span>. The modern use of the leopard as an emblem for sport or a <span>coat of arms</span> is much more restricted to Africa, though numerous products worldwide have used the name. During the <span>Benin Empire</span>, the leopard was used to symbolize the power of the king or <i>oba</i>.</p>
<p>Leopard domestication has also been recorded&#x2014;several leopards were kept in a menagerie established by <span>King John</span> at the <span>Tower of London</span> in the 13th century; around 1235, three of these animals were given to <span>Henry III</span> by Holy Roman Emperor <span>Frederick II</span>.</p>

<p>The lion passant guardant or leopard is a frequently used <span>charge</span> in <span>heraldry</span>, most commonly appearing in groups of three. The heraldic leopard lacks spots and sports a mane, making it visually almost identical to the <span>heraldic lion</span>, and the two are often used interchangeably. These traditional lions passant guardant appear in the <span>coat of arms of England</span> and many of its former colonies; more modern naturalistic (leopard-like) depictions appear on the coat of arms of several African nations including <span>Benin</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> and <span>Gabon</span>, which uses a black panther.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h3>
<p>Park reserves in several countries operate wildlife touring programs that allow visitors to observe leopards in their natural habitat. The <span>Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve</span> in South Africa is one such establishment that offers safari ventures. Sri Lanka offers two leopard habitats, <span>Yala National Park</span> and <span>Wilpattu National Park</span>, where wildlife tours are available. In India, leopards can be seen in the <span>Madhya Pradesh</span> and <span>Uttarakhand</span> national parks.</p>
<p>While luxury establishments may boast the fact that wild animals can be seen at close range on a daily basis, the leopard's camouflage and propensity to hide and stalk prey typically make leopard sightings rare. For example, in Sri Lanka's <span>Yala National Park</span>, leopards have been ranked by visitors to be among the least visible of all animals in the park despite their high concentration in the reserve.</p>

<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Leopard attack</span></div>
<p>Most leopards avoid people, but humans may occasionally be targeted as prey. Most healthy leopards prefer wild prey to humans, but injured, sickly, or struggling cats or those with a shortage of regular prey may resort to hunting humans and become habituated to it. Although usually slightly smaller than humans, an adult leopard is much more powerful and easily capable of killing them. Two extreme cases occurred in India: the first leopard, "the <span>Leopard of Rudraprayag</span>", killed more than 125 people; the second, the "<span>Panar Leopard</span>", was believed to have killed more than 400. Both were killed by the renowned hunter <span>Jim Corbett</span>. Man-eating leopards are considered bold and difficult to track by feline standards and may enter human settlements for prey, more so than lions and tigers. Author and big game hunter <span>Kenneth Anderson</span> had first-hand experience with many man-eating leopards, and described them as far more threatening than tigers:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Although examples of such animals are comparatively rare, when they do occur they depict the panther [leopard] as an engine of destruction quite equal to his far larger cousin, the tiger. Because of his smaller size he can conceal himself in places impossible to a tiger, his need for water is far less, and in veritable demoniac cunning and daring, coupled with the uncanny sense of self preservation and stealthy disappearance when danger threatens, he has no equal.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>There is something very terrifying in the angry grunt of a charging leopard, and I have seen a line of elephants that were staunch to a tiger, turn and stampede from a charging leopard.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite">&#x2014;Jim Corbett,&#xA0;<cite>-<i>The Temple Tiger and more Man-Eaters of Kumaon</i>,chapter "The Panar Man-Eater""</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 2012, two people were killed by leopards in separate attacks in distant parts of India.</p>
