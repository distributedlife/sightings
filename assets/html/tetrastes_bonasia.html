<p>The <b>hazel grouse</b> or <b>hazel hen</b> (<i>Tetrastes bonasia</i>) is one of the smaller members of the <span>grouse</span> family of <span>birds</span>. It is a sedentary <span>species</span>, breeding across northern <span>Eurasia</span> as far east as <span>Hokkaido</span>, and as far west as central and eastern <span>Europe</span>, in dense, damp, mixed <span>coniferous</span> woodland, preferably with some <span>spruce</span>.</p>
<p>The nest is on the ground, and 3&#x2013;6 <span>eggs</span> is the normal <span>clutch size</span>. The female takes all responsibility for incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks, as is typical with gamebirds.</p>

Hazel grouse</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a relatively small grouse at 35&#x2013;39 centimetres (14&#x2013;15&#xA0;in) length. The <span>plumage</span> of this plump bird is finely patterned, but hazel grouse essentially has grey upperparts, brown wings and chestnut flecked white underparts.</p>
<p>The male has a short erectile crest and a white-bordered black throat. The female has a shorter crest and lacks the black throat. In flight, this species shows a black-tipped grey tail.</p>
<p>The male has a high-pitched <i>ti-ti-ti-ti-ti</i> call, and the female a liquid <i>tettettettettet</i>. The calls, or the burr of the flying birds' wings, are often the only indication of this grouse's presence, since its shyness and dense woodland habitat make it difficult to see.</p>
<p>This bird feeds on the ground, taking mainly plant food, supplemented by <span>insects</span> when breeding.</p>
