<p>The <b>Ross's gull</b> (<i>Rhodostethia rosea</i>) is a small <span>gull</span>, the <span>only species</span> in its <span>genus</span>, although it has been suggested it should be moved to the genus <i><span>Hydrocoloeus</span></i>, which otherwise only includes the <span>little gull</span>. This bird is named after the British explorer <span>James Clark Ross</span>. Its breeding grounds were first discovered in 1905 by <span>Sergei Aleksandrovich Buturlin</span> near village of <span>Pokhodsk</span> in North-Eastern <span>Yakutia</span>, while visiting the area as a  judge.</p>

<p>This small <span>bird</span> is similar in size and some <span>plumage</span> characteristics to the <span>little gull</span>. It is slightly larger and longer winged than that species, and has more-pointed wings and a wedge-shaped tail. Its legs are red. Summer adults are pale grey above and white below, with a pink flush to the breast, and a neat black neck ring. In winter, the breast tints and neck collar are lost and a small dark crescent develops behind the eye.</p>
<p>Young birds resemble winter adults, but have a dark "W" pattern on the wings in flight, like young little gulls. The juveniles take two years to attain full adult plumage.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Ross's gull breeds in the high <span>Arctic</span> of northernmost <span>North America</span>, and northeast <span>Siberia</span>. It <span>migrates</span> only short distances south in autumn, most of the population wintering in northern latitudes at the edge of the <span>pack ice</span> in the northern Bering Sea and in the Sea of Okhotsk, although some birds reach more temperate areas, such as north west <span>Europe</span>. In North America, a Ross's gull has been spotted as far south as <span>Salton Sea</span> in <span>California</span>, although sightings this far south are extremely rare. The summer breeding grounds are tundra with sedges, grass tussocks, dwarf willows, bushes, lichens and pools.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology">Biology</span></h2>
<p>The Ross's gull breeds in small <span>colonies</span> on tundras and <span>swampy</span> Arctic estuaries, often nesting with other seabirds such as <span>Arctic terns</span>. It lays two to three <span>eggs</span> in a <span>nest</span> on the ground lined with seaweed, grass or moss, often on an island in a little lake. The eggs are olive green with small reddish-brown spots. Incubation takes about three weeks and the chicks fledge in another three weeks. Not all pairs successfully rear their young as predators and bad weather often take their toll.</p>
<p>This bird will eat any suitable small <span>prey</span> such as small fish and crustaceans, and during the winter often feeds on mudflats like a <span>wader</span>. During the breeding season it is largely <span>insectivorous</span>, feeding on beetles and flies.</p>
