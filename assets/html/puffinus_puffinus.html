<p>The <b>Manx shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus puffinus</i>) is a medium-sized <span>shearwater</span> in the <span>seabird</span> family <span>Procellariidae</span>. The scientific name of this <span>species</span> records a name shift: <i>Manx shearwaters</i> were called <i>Manks puffins</i> in the 17th century. Puffin is an <span>Anglo-Norman</span> word (<span>Middle English</span> <i>pophyn</i>) for the cured carcasses of nestling shearwaters. The <span>Atlantic puffin</span> acquired the name much later, possibly because of its similar nesting habits.</p>

<p>This <span>bird</span> is 30&#x2013;38&#xA0;cm long, with a 76&#x2013;89&#xA0;cm wingspan. It has the typically "shearing" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from black to white as the black upperparts and white undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>At some time or another, every living one of the middle-sized species of <i>Puffinus</i> has been considered a subspecies of <i>P. puffinus</i>. The extant <span>yelkouan shearwater</span> and <span>Balearic shearwater</span> (Sangster <i>et al.</i> 2002), <span>Hutton's shearwater</span>, <span>black-vented shearwater</span>, <span>Townsend's shearwater</span>, the <span>Hawaiian shearwater</span>, and the <span>fluttering shearwater</span> are now considered good species. Of these, only the Hawaiian and possibly Townsend's shearwaters seem to be somewhat closely related to the Manx shearwater (Austin 1996); the former <i>Puffinus puffinus</i> "<span>superspecies</span>" has turned out to be a number of more or less distantly related lineages. However, including the extinct forms listed below, at least the Mediterranean taxa do apparently constitute a superspecies in their own right, and maybe the New Zealand ones also.</p>
<p>Also belonging to this complex seem to be several <span>extinct</span> species:</p>

<p>Undescribed remains found on <span>Menorca</span> may belong to an already-named or a new taxon; they are not from the Balearic shearwater (Alcover 2001) which is possibly closer to <i>P. holeae</i> than to any other known species, living or extinct. There also existed a Late <span>Pliocene</span>/Early <span>Pleistocene</span> species known from <span>Ibiza</span>, <i><span>Puffinus nestori</span></i>, which may have been the direct ancestor of the <span>Mediterranean shearwater</span> (Heidrich <i>et al.</i> 1998).</p>
<p>The <span>Atlantic</span> forms are <span>parapatric</span> whereas the <span>Pacific</span> forms are <span>sympatric</span> or were not too long ago (Holdaway <i>et al.</i> 2001) and are <span>reproductively isolated</span> by a different <span>circannual</span> rhythm.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The prefix <i>Manx</i>, meaning from the <span>Isle of Man</span>, originated owing to the once large colony of Manx shearwaters found on the <span>Calf of Man</span> (a small island just south of the Isle of Man). The species became extinct as a breeding bird there owing to the accidental introduction of rats from a shipwreck in the late 18th century; however a recent control program has resulted in Manx shearwaters returning to breed in small numbers.</p>

Manx shearwater</div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Manx shearwaters are long-lived birds. A Manx shearwater breeding on <span>Copeland Island</span>, <span>Northern Ireland</span>, was as of 2003/04 the oldest known living wild bird in the world: <span>ringed</span> as an adult (at least 5 years old) in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least 55 years old.</p>
<p>This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on <span>migration</span> in autumn. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_and_feeding">Food and feeding</span></h3>
<p>The Manx shearwater feeds on small <span>fish</span> (particularly <span>herring</span>, <span>sprat</span> and <span>sardines</span>), <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>cephalopods</span> and surface <span>offal</span>. The bird forages individually or in small flocks, and it makes use of feeding <span>marine mammals</span> and schools of predatory fish, which push prey species up to the surface. It does not follow boats.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>This species breeds in the North Atlantic, with major colonies on islands and coastal cliffs around Great Britain and Ireland. Manx shearwaters have nested along the Atlantic coast of northeastern North America since the 1970s and have expanded their breeding range southward into the <span>Gulf of Maine</span>, with a pair confirmed as nesting at <span>Matinicus Rock</span>. They nest in <span>burrows</span>, laying one white egg which they visit only at night to avoid predation by large <span>gulls</span>. The islands are usually free of mammalian predators (but on the island of <span>R&#xF9;m</span>, about 4&#xA0;percent of the chicks are preyed on by <span>red deer</span> that need extra calcium.) They form lifelong monogamous pair-bonds.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>
<p>Manx shearwaters <span>migrate</span> over 10,000&#xA0;km to <span>South America</span> in winter, using waters off southern <span>Brazil</span> and <span>Argentina</span>, so the 55-year-old bird mentioned above probably covered over a million&#xA0;km on migration alone (not counting day-to-day fishing trips). Their migration also appears to be quite complex, containing many stopovers and foraging zones throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Ornithologist <span>Chris Mead</span> estimated that a bird ringed in 1957 (aged about 5 years) and still breeding on <span>Bardsey Island</span> off <span>Wales</span> in April 2002 had flown over 8 million&#xA0;km (5 million miles) during its 50-year life.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Folklore">Folklore</span></h2>
<p>In the 19th-century Manx novel <i><span>The Manxman</span></i> by <span>Sir Hall Caine</span>, a reference is made to the satanic folklore surrounding the Manx shearwater, apparently due to its unusual call and dark appearance.</p>
