<p>The <b>steenbok</b> (<i>Raphicerus campestris</i>) is a common small <span>antelope</span> of southern and eastern <span>Africa</span>. It is sometimes known as the <b>steinbuck</b> or <b>steinbok</b>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Steenbok resemble small <span>Oribi</span>, standing 45&#x2013;60cm (16"-24") at the shoulder. Their <span>pelage</span> (coat) is any shade from fawn to rufous, typically rather orange. The underside, including chin and throat, is white, as is the ring around the eye. Ears are large with "finger-marks" on the inside. Males have straight, smooth, parallel <span>horns</span> 7&#x2013;19 cm long (see image left). There is a black crescent-shape between the ears, a long black bridge to the glossy black nose, and a black circular scent-gland in front of the eye. The tail is not usually visible, being only 4&#x2013;6 cm long.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>There are two distinct clusters in steenbok distribution. In <span>East Africa</span>, it occurs in central and southern <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. It was formerly widespread in <span>Uganda</span>, but is now possibly extinct there. In <span>southern Africa</span>, it occurs in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and probably <span>Lesotho</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Steenbok can use a variety of <span>habitats</span> from <span>semi-desert</span>, such as the edge of the <span>Kalahari Desert</span> and <span>Etosha National Park</span>, to open woodland and thickets, including open <span>plains</span>, stony <span>savannah</span>, and <i><span>Acacia</span></i>&#x2013;<span>grassland</span> <span>mosaics</span>. They are said to favour unstable or transitional habitats. At least in the central part of <span>Kruger National Park</span>, South Africa, Steenbok show a distinct preference for <i><span>Acacia tortilis</span></i> savannah throughout the year, with no tendency to migrate to moister areas in the dry season (unlike many African savannah ungulates, including species <span>sympatric</span> with Steenbok in the wet season).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>Steenbok typically <span>browse</span> on low-level vegetation (they cannot reach above 0.9 m), but are also adept at scraping up roots and tubers. In central Kruger National Park, Steenbok show a distinct preference for <span>forbs</span>, and then woody plants (especially <i><span>Flueggea virosa</span></i>) when few forbs are available. They will also take fruits and only very rarely <span>graze</span> on <span>grass</span>. They are almost entirely independent of drinking water, gaining the moisture they need from their food.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>During cool periods, steenbok are active throughout the day; however, during hotter periods, they rest under shade during the heat of the day. While resting, they may be busy grooming, <span>ruminating</span> or taking brief spells of sleep.</p>

Steenbok typically lie low in vegetation cover at the first sign of threat</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the first sign of trouble, steenbok typically lie low in the vegetation. If a predator or perceived threat comes closer, a steenbok will leap away and follow a zigzag route to try to shake off the pursuer. Escaping steenbok frequently stop to look back, and flight is alternated with prostration during extended pursuit. They are known to take refuge in the burrows of <span>Aardvarks</span>. Known predators include <span>African wild cat</span>, <span>caracal</span>, <span>jackals</span>, <span>leopard</span>, <span>martial eagle</span> and <span>pythons</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Steenbok are typically solitary, except for when a pair come together to <span>mate</span>. However, it has been suggested that pairs occupy consistent <span>territories</span> while living independently, staying in contact through <span>scent markings</span>, so that they know where their mate is most of the time. Scent marking is primarily through <span>dung middens</span>. Territories range from 4 hectares to one square kilometre. The male is aggressive during the female's <span>oestrus</span>, engaging in "bluff-and-bluster" type displays with rival males&#x2014;prolonged contests invariably involve well-matched individuals, usually in their prime.</p>
<p>Breeding occurs throughout the year, although more fawns are born November to December in the southern spring&#x2013;summer; some females may breed twice a year. <span>Gestation period</span> is about 170 days, and usually a single <span>precocious</span> fawn is produced. The fawn is kept hidden in vegetation for 2 weeks, but they suckle for 3 months. Females become sexually mature at 6&#x2013;8 months and males at 9 months.</p>
<p>Steenbok are known to live for 7 years or more.</p>

Steenbok <span>phylogenetic</span> relationships (simplified)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two <span>subspecies</span> are recognized: <i>R. c. campestris</i> in Southern Africa and <i>R. c. naumanni</i> of East Africa; although <span>MSW3</span> also recognizes <i>capricornis</i> and <i>kelleni</i>. Up to 24 subspecies have been described from Southern Africa, distinguished on such features as coat colour.</p>
