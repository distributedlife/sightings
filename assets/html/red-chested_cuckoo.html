<p/>

<p>It is found in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Benin</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Burundi</span>, <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Central African Republic</span>, <span>Chad</span>, <span>Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Ivory Coast</span>, <span>Equatorial Guinea</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Gabon</span>, <span>Gambia</span>, <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Guinea</span>, <span>Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>Liberia</span>, <span>Malawi</span>, <span>Mali</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Sierra Leone</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Togo</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, and <span>Zimbabwe</span>.

<p>The preferred habitats for the red-chested cuckoo are woodlands. The red-chested cuckoo is normally seen by itself rather than in the company of birds of the same species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It is usually solitary and highly vocal and lives on forests and plantations. It eats insects.</p>
<p>The red-chested cuckoo takes on more than a single mate (it is <span>polygamous</span>). The nesting habit of red-chested cuckoo is to use the nest of another bird. About fifteen different species of small bird are parasitised but the most common hosts are the <span>Cape robin-chat</span> (<i>Cossypha caffra</i>), the <span>Cape wagtail</span> (<i>Motacilla capensis</i>) and the <span>white-throated robin-chat</span> (<i>Cossypha humeralis</i>). The surrogate family then raise the chick. The bird lays eggs which are brown in colour and number between 20 eggs per season in different nests.</p>
