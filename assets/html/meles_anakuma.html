<p>The <b>Japanese badger</b> (<i>Meles anakuma</i>) is a species of <span>carnivoran</span> of the family <span>Mustelidae</span>, the <span>weasels</span> and their kin. It is <span>endemic</span> to <span>Japan</span>, where it is found on <span>Honshu</span>, <span>Kyushu</span>, <span>Shikoku</span>, and <span>Shodoshima</span>. It shares the genus <i><span>Meles</span></i> with the <span>Asian</span> and <span>European</span> <span>badgers</span>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Japanese badgers are smaller (average length 79&#xA0;cm (31&#xA0;in) in males, 72&#xA0;cm (28&#xA0;in) in females) and less <span>sexually dimorphic</span> (except in the size of the canine teeth) than their European counterparts. Tail length is between 14 and 20&#xA0;cm (5.5 and 7.9&#xA0;in). Adults usually weigh from 4 to 8&#xA0;kg (8.8 to 17.6&#xA0;lb). The torso is blunt and limbs are short. The front feet are equipped with powerful digging claws. The claws on hind feet are smaller. The upper coat has long gray-brown hair. Ventral hair is short and black. The face has characteristic black-white stripes that are not as distinct as in the European badger. The dark color is concentrated around the eyes. The skull is smaller than in the European badger.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
<p>The absence of badgers from <span>Hokkaido</span>, and the presence of related <i><span>M. leucurus</span></i> in <span>Korea</span>, suggest that the ancestral badgers reached Japan from the southwest via Korea. Genetic studies indicate that there are substantial differences between Japanese and Asian badgers, which were formerly considered <span>conspecific</span>, and that the Japanese badgers are genetically more homogenous.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits">Habits</span></h2>
<p>Japanese badgers are <span>nocturnal</span> and <span>hibernate</span> during the coldest months of the year. Beginning at 2 years of age, females mate and give birth to litters of two or three cubs in the spring (March-April). They mate again shortly afterwards, but <span>delay implantation</span> until the following February. Japanese badgers are more solitary than <span>European badgers</span>; they do not aggregate into social clans, and mates do not form <span>pair bonds</span>. During mating season, the range of a male badger overlaps with those of 2 to 3 females.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitats">Habitats</span></h2>
<p>Japanese badgers are found in a variety of woodland and forest habitats.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>Japanese badgers have an omnivorous diet that includes worms, beetles, berries and <span>persimmons</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats">Threats</span></h2>
<p>Although they remain common, their range has shrunk recently. They presently range over about 29 per cent of the country, an area that has shrunk 7 per cent over the last 25 years. Increased land development and agriculture, as well as competition from introduced <span>raccoons</span> are threats. Hunting is legal but has declined sharply since the 1970s.</p>
