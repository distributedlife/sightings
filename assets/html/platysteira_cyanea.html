<p>This species breeds in west, central and northeast tropical <span>Africa</span>. This common species is found in secondary forest and other woodland areas, including gardens. The <span>eggs</span> are laid in a small neat <span>lichen</span> and <span>cobweb</span> cup low in a tree or bush.</p>
<p>The adult Brown-throated Wattle-eye is a stout bird about 14&#xA0;cm (5.5&#xA0;in) long. The breeding male has glossy black upperparts, and white underparts with a neat black breast band. There is a strong white wingbar, and fleshy red wattles above the eye.</p>
<p>The females are grey-black above, and also have the white wing bar and red wattles. There is a small patch of white below the bill, and the throat and breast are maroon, separated from the white belly by the black breast band. Young males are washed-out, greyer versions of the female.</p>
<p>These active insect-eating birds are found in pairs or small groups. The ringing call of the Brown-throated Wattle-eye is a very characteristic six note <i><span>doo-dd-dum-di-do-do</span>.</i></p>
