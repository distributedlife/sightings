<p>The <b>mugimaki flycatcher</b> (<i>Ficedula mugimaki</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of eastern <span>Asia</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Ficedula</span></i> in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family, Muscicapidae. The name "mugimaki" comes from <span>Japanese</span> and means "wheat-sower". The bird is also known as the <b>robin flycatcher</b>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is 13 to 13.5 centimetres long. It has a rattling call and often flicks its wings and tail. The adult male has blackish upperparts with a short white <span>supercilium</span> behind the eye, a white wing-patch, white edges to the <span>tertials</span> and white at the base of the outer tail-feathers. The breast and throat are orange-red while the belly and undertail-coverts are white. The female is grey-brown above with a pale orange-brown breast and throat. She lacks white in the tail, has one or two pale wingbars rather than a white wing-patch and has a supercilium that is either faint or absent entirely. Young males are similar to the female but have a brighter orange breast, white in the tail and a more obvious supercilium.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It breeds in eastern <span>Siberia</span> and north-east <span>China</span>. <span>Migrating</span> birds pass through eastern China, <span>Korea</span> and <span>Japan</span> in spring and autumn. The species winters in <span>Southeast Asia</span>, reaching western <span>Indonesia</span> and the <span>Philippines</span>. There is a single record of a <span>vagrant</span> bird in <span>Alaska</span>; on <span>Shemya</span> Island in 1985. A bird in <span>Humberside</span>, <span>England</span> in 1991 was not accepted into Category A, a wild bird, but was put in a Category D, meaning likely to be of captive origin. It was retained in Category D following a review in 2009.</p>
<p>The main <span>habitats</span> are forest and woodland, particularly at higher elevations. It is also found in parks and gardens during migration. It usually occurs alone or in small groups, feeding on flying <span>insects</span> in the tree canopy.</p>
