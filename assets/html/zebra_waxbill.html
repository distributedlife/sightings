<p>The <b>Orange-breasted Waxbill</b> or <b>Zebra Waxbill</b> (<i>Amandava subflava</i>) is a small (approximately 9&#xA0;cm long) sparrow-like bird with a reddish <span>iris</span>, orange breast, red <span>bill</span> and dark olive-green <span>plumage</span>. The male has a red rump, dark bars on the whitish flank and a <span>scarlet</span> eyebrow stripe. The female is duller and smaller than male; it lacks the male's red eyebrow.</p>
<p>The Orange-breasted Waxbill is found in grassland and <span>savannas</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span> in <span>Africa</span>. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;. This species is also introduced to other countries, e.g., <span>Kuwait</span>. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, <span>insects</span> and shoots. The female usually lays between four and six <span>eggs</span> in oval-shaped <span>nest</span> made from grass. These nests are often the old nests of <span>Red-collared Widowbirds</span>.</p>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large <span>range</span>, the Orange-breasted Waxbill is evaluated as Least Concern on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of <span>CITES</span> in <span>Ghana</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
<p>Origin and <span>phylogeny</span> has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).</p>
