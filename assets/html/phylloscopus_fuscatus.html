<p>The <b>dusky warbler</b> (<i>Phylloscopus fuscatus</i>) is a <span>leaf warbler</span> which breeds in east <span>Asia</span>. This warbler is strongly <span>migratory</span> and winters in southeast <span>Asia</span>. It sometimes occurs in <span>North America</span> in <span>Alaska</span>, and has also occurred in <span>California</span>.</p>
<p>This is an abundant <span>bird</span> of <span>taiga</span> bogs and wet meadows. The nest is built low in a bush, and 5-6 <span>eggs</span> are laid. Like most <span>Old World warblers</span>, this small <span>passerine</span> is <span>insectivorous</span>.</p>
<p>The dusky warbler is prone to vagrancy as far as western <span>Europe</span> in October, despite a 3000&#xA0;km distance from its breeding grounds. It has wintered in <span>Great Britain</span>.</p>
<p>This is a warbler similar in size and shape to a <span>chiffchaff</span>. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. There is a prominent whitish supercilium, and the bill is fine and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more olive-tinged above. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will take other small food items, including berries.</p>
<p>The song is a monotonous whistle, and the call is a harsh <i>check</i>. The call is often the first clue that this typically <span>skulking</span> species is present, away from the breeding grounds.</p>
