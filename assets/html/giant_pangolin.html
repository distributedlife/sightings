<p>The <b>giant pangolin</b> (<i>Manis gigantea</i>) is a <span>pangolin</span> <span>species</span>. Members of the species inhabit <span>Africa</span> with a <span>range</span> stretching along the <span>equator</span> from <span>West Africa</span> to <span>Uganda</span>. The giant pangolin is the largest species of pangolins, or "scaly anteaters" &#x2013; the large, scaled mammals belonging to the <span>family</span> <span>Manidae</span>. It subsists almost entirely on <span>ants</span> and <span>termites</span>. The species was first described by <span>Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger</span> in 1815.</p>

<p>The giant pangolin inhabits many countries, with the largest concentration in <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and western <span>Kenya</span>. It is found mainly in the <span>savanna</span>, <span>rainforest</span>, and <span>forest</span>, inhabiting areas with large <span>termite</span> populations and available <span>water</span>. It does not inhabit high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>Due to <span>habitat destruction</span> and <span>deforestation</span>, the species is in great decline, and this, together with <span>hunting</span> of it as <span>bushmeat</span> and for the supposed medicinal properties of its scales, has led to concerns about population levels. Because the species is <span>nocturnal</span>, few studies have been carried out. Currently, this pangolin is classified as a "<span>least concern</span>" by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_description">Physical description</span></h2>
<p>The giant pangolin is the largest of all pangolin species. While its average <span>mass</span> has not been measured, one specimen was found to weigh 33 kg (72.6 lb). Males are larger than females, with male body lengths about 140 cm (4.6 ft) and females about 125 cm (4.1 ft). Like all pangolins, the species is armored with large, brown to reddish-brown scales formed from keratin. Curiously, it also has <span>eyelashes</span>. The giant pangolin has a long <span>snout</span>, a long, thick <span>tail</span>, and large front <span>claws</span>.</p>
<p>The animal has a strong <span>sense</span> of <span>smell</span> and large <span>anal glands</span>. Its <span>secretions</span> may be significant to <span>animal communication</span>. The species walks with most of its weight is on its columnar rear legs, and curls its front paws, walking on the outside of the <span>wrists</span> rather than the palms to protect the claws. By using its tail for balance, it will often walk upright as a <span>biped</span>.</p>

<p>The giant pangolin, like other pangolins, is nocturnal, which makes observation difficult. It is also usually <span>solitary</span>, although in one case an adult was seen in a <span>burrow</span> with a juvenile. The species is capable of climbing trees and other objects.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>Like all pangolins, the giant pangolin is a specialized <span>insectivore</span> that lacks <span>teeth</span> and the ability to <span>chew</span>. Its diet mainly consists of <span>ants</span> and <span>termites</span>, which it finds by tearing open <span>anthills</span> and termite nests, both subterranean and mound-type.</p>
<p>Because of its relatively large size, the giant pangolin is particularly well-suited to breaking open termite mounds by leaning on the mound and resting its weight on its tail, and then ripping into the mound with its front claws. The combination of weight and physical damage quickly leads to a partial collapse of the mound, exposing the termites. Only the adults are strong enough to do this; their young must follow behind their mothers until they grow large enough to do it for themselves. It eats the <span>insects</span> by picking them up with its sticky <span>tongue</span>, which is up to 16 in long.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>Very little information about the <span>reproduction</span> of the giant pangolin is known. Two birth records exist, with one <span>litter</span> in September and another in October, with the young weighing around 500 g. As in all pangolins, infants have soft scales that eventually harden, and are born with open <span>eyes</span>. They cannot walk on their legs, but can move on their bellies. During age 6-8 weeks the young will often spew a yellow secretion from their anal glands(that is often said to smell of decay and cabbage) that is used to keep predators and other animals from taking advantage of their mothers.</p>
