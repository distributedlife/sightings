<p>The <b>pine grosbeak</b> (<i>Pinicola enucleator</i>) is a large member of the true <span>finch</span> <span>family</span>, <span>Fringillidae</span>. It is found in <span>coniferous</span> woods across <span>Alaska</span>, the western mountains of the <span>United States</span>, <span>Canada</span>, and in <span>subarctic</span> <span>Fennoscandia</span> and <span>Siberia</span>. During winter, pine grosbeaks in parts of North America move southward, bringing them as far south as the upper <span>Midwest</span> and <span>New England</span> in the <span>United States</span>, but sometimes even further south, especially during an <span>irruption</span>. This species is a very rare vagrant to <span>temperate</span> <span>Europe</span>; in all of <span>Germany</span> for example, not more than 4 individuals and often none at all have been recorded each year since 1980.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>

<p>This species is one of the largest species in the <span>true finch</span> family. It measures from 20 to 25.5&#xA0;cm (7.9 to 10.0&#xA0;in) in length and weighs from 52 to 78&#xA0;g (1.8 to 2.8&#xA0;oz), with an average mass of 56.4&#xA0;g (1.99&#xA0;oz). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 10.2 to 11.6&#xA0;cm (4.0 to 4.6&#xA0;in), the <span>tail</span> is 7.8 to 9.5&#xA0;cm (3.1 to 3.7&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 1.4 to 1.65&#xA0;cm (0.55 to 0.65&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 1.9 to 2.3&#xA0;cm (0.75 to 0.91&#xA0;in). Adults have a long forked black tail, black wings with white wing bars and a large bill. Adult males have a rose-red head, back and rump. Adult females are olive-yellow on the head and rump and grey on the back and underparts. Young birds have a less contrasting <span>plumage</span> overall, appearing shaggy when they <span>moult</span> their colored head plumage.</p>
<p>Its voice is geographically variable, and includes a whistled <i>pui pui pui</i> or <i>chii-vli</i>. The <span>song</span> is a short musical warble.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>The breeding habitat of the pine grosbeak is <span>coniferous</span> <span>forests</span>. They nest on a horizontal branch or in a fork of a conifer. This bird is a permanent resident through most of its range; in the extreme north or when food sources are scarce, they may <span>migrate</span> further south.</p>
<p>Pine grosbeaks <span>forage</span> in trees and bushes. They mainly eat <span>seeds</span>, buds, berries, and <span>insects</span>. Outside of the nesting season, they often feed in flocks.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systematics_and_evolution">Systematics and evolution</span></h2>
<p>The pine grosbeak, together with its <span>Himalayan</span> relative the <span>Crimson-browed Finch</span> (<i>P. subhimachala</i>), represents an ancient divergence from the same stock that also gave rise to the true <span>bullfinches</span> (<i><span>Pyrrhula</span></i>). The <i>Pinicola</i> lineage diverged from its relatives perhaps a dozen <span>million years ago</span>, during the <span>Clarendonian</span> <span>faunal stage</span> of the mid-<span>Miocene</span>.</p>
<p>At the same time, the <span>evolutionary radiation</span> of <i>Pyrrhula</i> throughout <span>Eurasia</span> and the <span>Holarctic</span> expansion of the closely related <i><span>Leucosticte</span></i> mountain finches and relatives began. These genera <span>evolved</span> in the interior of <span>Asia</span>, and thus the original <i>Pinicola</i> stock was probably already a conifer forest bird living to the north of the <span>Himalayas</span>. The separation of the modern species is likely the result of <span>climate change</span> which displaced <i>Pinicola</i> <span>habitat</span> to <span>subarctic</span> northern and <span>subalpine</span> Himalayan regions. Possibly, the ancestors of the North American pine grosbeaks were wind-blown individuals which arrived via the northern <span>Pacific</span>, as the <span>Bering Land Bridge</span> was generally submerged in the <span>Late Miocene</span>.</p>
<p>According to studies by Arnaiz-Villena et al., all birds belonging to the genus <i><span>Pyrrhula</span></i> have a common ancestor: <i>Pinicola enucleator</i>.</p>
