<p>The <b>ivory gull</b> (<i>Pagophila eburnea</i>) is a small <span>gull</span>, the <span>only species</span> in the genus <i><b>Pagophila</b></i>. It breeds in the high <span>Arctic</span> and has a circumpolar distribution through <span>Greenland</span>, northernmost <span>North America</span>, and <span>Eurasia</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The ivory gull was initially described by <span>Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave</span> in 1774 as <i>Larus eburneus</i> from a specimen collected on <span>Spitsbergen</span>. <span>Johann Jakob Kaup</span> later recognized the unique traits of the ivory gull and gave it a monotypic genus, <i>Pagophila</i>, in 1829. <span>Johan Ernst Gunnerus</span> later gave the species a new specific name, <i>Pagophila alba</i>. The scientific names Eburnea and Pagophila mean "Ivory-Coloured" and "lover of sea ice" from the Latin ebur for ivory and the Greek pagos for sea-ice respectively. Today some authors consider the ivory gull not deserving of its monotypic genus, instead to choosing to merge it, along with the other monotypic gulls, back into <i>Larus</i>. However, most authors have not chosen to do so. The ivory gull has no subspecies. No fossil members of this genus are known.</p>
<p>This gull is traditionally believed to be most closely related to either the <span>kittiwakes</span>, <span>Sabine's gull</span>, or <span>Ross's gull</span>. It differs anatomically from the other genera by having a relatively short <span>tarsometatarsus</span>, a narrower <span>os pubis</span>, and potentially more flexibility in skull kinetic structure. Structurally, it is most similar to the kittiwakes; however, recent genetic analysis based on <span>mtDNA</span> sequences shows that Sabine's gull is the ivory gull's closest relative, followed by the kittiwakes, with Ross's gull and <span>swallow-tailed gull</span> sharing a <span>clade</span> with these species. "Pagophila" is maintained as a unique genus because of the bird&#x2019;s morphological, behavioral and ecological differences from these species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This species is easy to identify. At 43 centimetres (17&#xA0;in), it has a different, more <span>pigeon</span>-like shape than the <i>Larus</i> gulls, but the adult has completely white <span>plumage</span>, lacking the grey back of other gulls. The thick <span>bill</span> is blue with a yellow tip, and the legs are black. Its <span>cry</span> is a harsh <i>eeeer</i>. Young birds have a dusky face and variable amounts of black flecking in the wings and tail. The juveniles take two years to attain full adult plumage. There are no differences in appearance across the species&#x2019; geographic range.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In North America, it only breeds in the <span>Canadian</span> <span>Arctic</span>. <span>Seymour Island</span>, <span>Nunavut</span> is home to the largest known breeding colony, while <span>Ellesmere</span>, <span>Devon</span>, <span>Cornwallis</span>, and north <span>Baffin Islands</span> are known locations of breeding colonies. It is believed that there are other small breeding colonies of less than six birds that are still undiscovered. There are no records of the ivory gull breeding in <span>Alaska</span>.</p>
<p>During the winter, ivory gulls live near <span>polynyas</span>, or a large area of open water surrounded by sea ice. North American birds, along with some from Greenland and Europe, winter along the 2000&#xA0;km of ice edge stretching between 50&#xB0; and 64&#xB0; N from the <span>Labrador Sea</span> to <span>Davis Strait</span> that is bordered by <span>Labrador</span> and southwestern Greenland. Wintering gulls are often seen on the eastern coasts of <span>Newfoundland</span> and Labrador and occasionally appear on the north shore of the <span>Gulf of St. Lawrence</span> and the interior of Labrador. It also winters from October through June in the <span>Bering Sea</span> and <span>Chukchi Seas</span>. It is most widespread throughout the polynyas and pack ice of the Bering Sea. It is also vagrant throughout coastal Canada and the northeastern United States, though records of individuals as far south as California and Georgia have been reported, as well as The <span>British Isles</span>, with most records from late November through early March. Juveniles tend to wander further from the Arctic than adults.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology_and_behavior">Ecology and behavior</span></h2>
<p>It <span>migrates</span> only short distances south in autumn, most of the population wintering in northern latitudes at the edge of the pack ice, although some birds reach more temperate areas.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>It takes <span>fish</span> and <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>rodents</span>, <span>eggs</span> and small chicks but is also an opportunist <span>scavenger</span>, often found on <span>seal</span> or <span>porpoise</span> corpses. It has been known to follow <span>polar bears</span> and other predators to feed on the remains of their kills.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>The ivory gull breeds on Arctic <span>coasts</span> and cliffs, laying one to three olive <span>eggs</span> in a ground <span>nest</span> lined with <span>moss</span>, <span>lichens</span>, or seaweed.</p>
