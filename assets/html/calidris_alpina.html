<p>The <b>dunlin</b> (<i>Calidris alpina</i>) is a small <span>wader</span>, sometimes separated with the other "<span>stints</span>" in <i>Erolia</i>. It is a circumpolar breeder in <span>Arctic</span> or subarctic regions. Birds that breed in <span>northern Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span> are long-distance <span>migrants</span>, wintering south to <span>Africa</span>, <span>southeast Asia</span> and the Middle East. Birds that breed in <span>Alaska</span> and the <span>Canadian</span> Arctic migrate short distances to the <span>Pacific</span> and <span>Atlantic</span> coasts of <span>North America</span>, although those nesting in Northern Alaska overwinter in Asia. Many dunlins winter along the Iberian south coast.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The dunlin is highly gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches. Large numbers can often be seen swirling in synchronized flight on stop-overs during migration or on their winter habitat.</p>
<p>This bird is one of the most common and best-known waders throughout its breeding and wintering ranges, and it is the species with which other waders tend to be compared. At 17&#x2013;21&#xA0;cm (6.7&#x2013;8.3&#xA0;in) length and with a 32&#x2013;36&#xA0;cm (13&#x2013;14&#xA0;in) <span>wingspan</span>, it is similar in size to a <span>common starling</span>, but stouter, with a thicker bill.</p>
<p>The dunlin moves along the coastal mudflat beaches it prefers with a characteristic "sewing machine" feeding action, methodically picking small food items. <span>Insects</span> form the main part of the dunlin's diet on the nesting grounds; it eats <span>mollusks</span>, <span>worms</span> and <span>crustaceans</span> in coastal areas.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>An adult dunlin in breeding plumage shows the distinctive black belly which no other similar-sized wader possesses. The winter dunlin is basically grey above and white below. Juveniles are brown above with two whitish "V" shapes on the back. They usually have black marks on the flanks or belly and show a strong white wingbar in flight.</p>
<p>The legs and slightly decurved bill are black. There are a number of <span>subspecies</span> differing mainly in the extent of rufous coloration in the breeding plumage and the bill length. Bill length varies between sexes, the females having longer bills than the males.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nesting">Nesting</span></h2>
<p>The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with vegetation, into which typically four eggs are laid and <span>incubated</span> by the male and female parents. Chicks are precocial, however are brooded during early development. They start to fly at approximately three weeks of age. The majority of brood care is provided by the male, as the female deserts the brood and often leaves the breeding area.</p>
<p>The call is a typical sandpiper "peep", and the display song a harsh trill.</p>
<p>The dunlin is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>Apparent <span>hybrids</span> between this species and the <span>white-rumped sandpiper</span> as well as with the <span>purple sandpiper</span> have been reported from the Atlantic coasts of North America (McLaughlin &amp; Wormington, 2000, and external link below) and <span>Europe</span> (Millington, 1994), respectively.</p>
