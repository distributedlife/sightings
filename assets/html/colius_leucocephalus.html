<p>The <b>White-headed Mousebird</b> (<i>Colius leucocephalus</i>) is a <span>bird</span> belonging to the <span>mousebird</span> family, Coliidae. It is found only in east <span>Africa</span> where it occurs in southern <span>Somalia</span> and parts of <span>Kenya</span> with its range just extending into southern <span>Ethiopia</span> and northern <span>Tanzania</span>. It inhabits arid bushland up to 1,400 metres above sea-level.</p>
<p>It is 32&#xA0;cm long with the long, graduated tail accounting for over half of this. The <span>plumage</span> is mainly greyish with black and white barring on the back, neck and breast. It has a white crest, crown and cheeks. There is a white stripe down the back which becomes visible when the bird flies. Around the eye is a patch of dark, bare skin. The <span>bill</span> is bluish-white above and buff below. In <span>juvenile</span> birds, the throat and breast are buff. The northern <span>subspecies</span> (<i>C. l. turneri</i>) is darker than the southern form (<i>C. l. leucocephalus</i>).</p>
<p>The contact call is a scratchy chattering and the bird also has a descending <span>song</span>.</p>
