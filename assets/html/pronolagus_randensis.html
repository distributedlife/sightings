<p><b>Jameson's red rock hare</b> (<i>Pronolagus randensis</i>) is a <span>leporid</span> found only on the <span>continent</span> of <span>Africa</span>, mostly in the southern portion of the continent. <span>South Africa</span> has a population of this <span>red rock hare</span> but it is only found in the northwestern part of the country. <span>Botswana</span> also has a population in the <span>Tswapong Hills</span>. <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>Namibia</span> are thought to have the largest populations of the red rock hare and it is said to be found throughout both countries.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Jameson's red rock hare is found in very rocky environments, this is where it gets its name. This red rock hare is found on the rocky slopes of mountainous regions of the southern African continent. It is also found in grassy or bushy areas on or around these mountains and it uses them as its shelter during resting periods and sleep.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This species has a fine, silky <span>fur</span> which is grizzled rufous-brown on the upper parts of the body. It has a whitish <span>chin</span> and slightly lighter fur on the <span>ventrum</span>. The sides of the <span>neck</span>, lower <span>jaw</span> and <span>cheeks</span> are light grey in colour. It has a large reddish-brown, black tipped <span>tail</span>. The large <span>ears</span> are sparsely haired and sometimes are tipped with black. When fully grown, this red rock hare can weigh more than 5 pounds.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<p>Very little is known about its <span>breeding</span> habits. It is assumed that breeding can and does occur year around and <span>females</span> give birth to one to three young per <span>litter</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Active by night, this species remains in hiding during the day and therefore is <span>nocturnal</span>. Solitary in habits, although it is sometimes seen in groups consisting of a female and her young. An <span>oestrus</span> female is often followed by courting males as with other species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Food">Food</span></h2>
<p>Jameson's red rock hare only feeds at night, when it is most active. It feeds on the vegetation and insects in and around its habitat including <span>grasses</span>, leaves, and certain <span>fruits</span>. As with other hares and rabbits, Jameson's red rock hare practices <span>coprophagy</span> in order to get the most nutrients out of its diet.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Human_interaction_and_impact">Human interaction and impact</span></h2>
<p>Jameson's red rock hare is not on any endangered or threatened list. The habitat it uses, as with many other animals' habitats, is endangered because of human encroachment. The continent of Africa, even the region this species is found, is often war-torn and this may affect Jameson's red rock hare, its habitat, or both. Currently, though, the population of Jameson's red rock hare appears to be stable.</p>
