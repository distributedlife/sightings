<p>The <b>band-rumped storm petrel</b>, <b>Madeiran storm petrel</b>, or <b>Harcourt's storm petrel</b> (<i>Oceanodroma castro</i>) is of the <span>storm petrel</span> family <span>Hydrobatidae</span>.</p>
<p>The band-rumped storm petrel is 19&#x2013;21&#xA0;cm in length with a 43&#x2013;46&#xA0;cm wingspan, and weighs 44&#x2013;49&#xA0;g. It is mainly black with an extensive white rump. Similar to <span>Leach's storm petrel</span> with the forked tail, long wings, and flight behaviour, but Leach's has a more forked tail and differently shaped white rump.</p>
<p>It breeds on islands in the warmer parts of the <span>Atlantic</span> and <span>Pacific Oceans</span>. These include the <span>Azores</span> and <span>Madeira</span> in the Atlantic, and the <span>Galapagos Islands</span> in the Pacific. It nests in colonies close to the sea in rock crevices and lays a single white egg. It spends the rest of the year at sea. They feed by picking up prey items (<span>invertebrates</span>, small <span>vertebrates</span> and sometimes <span>carrion</span>) from the water's surface. Occasionally, they make shallow dives, generally to 40&#x2013;120&#xA0;cm below the water's surface; a recorded maximum depth of 170&#xA0;cm seems highly unlikely and is probably due to equipment malfunction.</p>
<p>This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by <span>gulls</span> and <span>skuas</span>, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow.</p>
<p>Recent discoveries of 'cold season' and 'warm season' populations, which use the same nest sites at different times of year, and also differ in terms of <span>vocalisations</span> and <span>moult</span>, may hint at the existence of two 'cryptic species' within the currently understood limits of the species. After population genetic analyzes of mtDNA the warm season population in the <span>Azores</span> have been recognized as a separate species, <span>Monteiro's storm petrel</span>.</p>
