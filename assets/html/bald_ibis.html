<p>The small <span>bird</span> <span>genus</span> <i><b>Geronticus</b></i> belongs to the <span>ibis</span> <span>subfamily</span> (Threskiornithinae). Its name is derived from the <span>Greek</span> <i>g&#xE9;rontos</i> (&#x3B3;&#x3AD;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;, "old man") in reference to the bald head of these dark-plumaged birds; in <span>English</span> they are called <b>bald ibises</b>.</p>
<p><i>Geronticus</i> contains two living <span>species</span>. The <span>northern bald ibis</span> (<i>G. eremita</i>) has a neck crest of elongated <span>feathers</span>. It is a <span>Critically Endangered</span> species found around the <span>Mediterranean</span>. Its range had expanded after the <span>last glacial period</span> to the <span>Alps</span> of <span>Germany</span> and even a bit further north, but it was rendered <span>extinct</span> there mainly due to <span>habitat destruction</span> and unsustainable <span>hunting</span>. The <span>southern bald ibis</span> (<i>G. calvus</i>) with a red crown patch but no crest is classified as <span>Vulnerable</span> and is found in <span>subtropical</span> southern <span>Africa</span>.</p>

<p>Like most ibises, they are gregarious long-legged <span>wading birds</span> with long down-curved <span>bills</span>; they form one subfamily of the <span>Threskiornithidae</span>, the other subfamily being the <span>spoonbills</span>. The two <i>Geronticus</i> species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer <span>arid</span> habitats to the <span>wetlands</span> used by their relatives. Their food contains fewer <span>aquatic animals</span> and more <span>terrestrial</span> ones; they are known to gather together and feed on <span>locust</span> swarms, killing many of these notorious <span>pests</span>. This has also contributed to their decline however, as they were much affected by indiscriminate <span>pesticide</span> spraying in the mid-to-late 20th century, leading to their disappearance from many regions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fossil_record">Fossil record</span></h2>
<p><i><b>Geronticus perplexus</b></i> is by far the oldest <span>fossil</span> assigned to the present genus. It is known only from a piece of <span>distal</span> right <span>humerus</span>, found at <span>Sansan</span>, <span>France</span>, in <span>Middle Miocene</span> rocks of the <span>Serravallian</span> faunal stage <span>MN 6</span> (about 12-14 million years ago). It was initially considered to be a <span>heron</span> and placed in the genera <i><span>Ardea</span></i> and <i><span>Proardea</span></i>. More <span>plesiomorphic</span> than the living species, it seems to represent an ancient member of the <i>Geronticus</i> lineage, in line with the theory that most living ibis genera seem to have <span>evolved</span> before 15 million years ago (mya).</p>
<p><i><b>Geronticus apelex</b></i> is apparently the direct ancestor of the southern bald ibis. Its remains were found in <span>Early Pliocene</span> deposits near <span>Langebaanweg</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, which date back about five million years.</p>
<p>What may be an ancestral <span>European</span> form, <i><b>Geronticus balcanicus</b></i>, was found in a <span>Late Pliocene</span> deposit near <span>Slivnitsa</span>, <span>Bulgaria</span>. It is hitherto only known from one left and one right <span>carpometacarpus</span> piece (<span>NMNHS</span> 14 and NMNHS 453, respectively) which are almost identical to those of living bald ibises. Contemporaneous with these during the early <span>MN18</span> <span>faunal stage</span> &#x2013; about two mya &#x2013; birds entirely indistinguishable from the modern northern bald ibis inhabited at least <span>Spain</span>, if not the whole western Mediterranean region already. Thus, the extinct species may be the immediate ancestor of <i>G. eremita</i>, which would have originated at the western extent of its range. Some authors even include the Bulgarian population in <i>G. eremita</i>, but most are more cautious. <i>G. balcanicus</i> may also represent a lineage related but not ancestral to the northern bald ibis, which inhabited the inland regions northeastwards of the European <span>Alpides</span> and &#x2013; like the immediate ancestor of <i>G. eremita</i> in this scenario &#x2013; was isolated from the ancestors of <i>G. calvus</i> when <span>gene flow</span> across <span>tropical</span> Africa ceased.</p>
