<p>The <b>great egret</b> (<i>Ardea alba</i>) also known as <b>common egret</b>, <b>large egret</b> or (in the <span>Old World</span>) <b>great white heron</b>, is a large, widely distributed <span>egret</span>. Distributed across most of the <span>tropical</span> and warmer <span>temperate</span> regions of the world, in southern <span>Europe</span> it is rather localized. In <span>North America</span> it is more widely distributed, and it is ubiquitous across the <span>Sun Belt</span> of the United States and in the <span>Neotropics</span>. The Old World population is often referred to as the <b>great white egret.</b> This species is sometimes confused with the <b>great white heron</b> of the <span>Caribbean</span>, which is a white <span>morph</span> of the closely related <span>great blue heron</span> (<i>A. herodias</i>).</p>

<p>The great egret is a large heron with all-white <span>plumage</span>. Standing up to 1&#xA0;m (3.3&#xA0;ft) tall, this species can measure 80 to 104&#xA0;cm (31 to 41&#xA0;in) in length and have a <span>wingspan</span> of 131 to 170&#xA0;cm (52 to 67&#xA0;in). Body mass can range from 700 to 1,500&#xA0;g (1.5 to 3.3&#xA0;lb), with an average of around 1,000&#xA0;g (2.2&#xA0;lb). It is thus only slightly smaller than the <span>great blue</span> or <span>grey heron</span> (<i>A. cinerea</i>). Apart from size, the great egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow <span>bill</span> and black legs and feet, though the bill may become darker and the lower legs lighter in the breeding season. In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like non-breeding adults. Differentiated from the <span>intermediate egret</span> (<i>Mesophoyx intermedius</i>) by the <span>gape</span>, which extends well beyond the back of the eye in case of the great egret, but ends just behind the eye in case of the intermediate egret.</p>
<p>It has a slow flight, with its neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and <span>bitterns</span>, and distinguishes them from <span>storks</span>, <span>cranes</span>, <span>ibises</span>, and <span>spoonbills</span>, which extend their necks in flight.</p>
<p>The great egret is not normally a vocal bird; at breeding colonies, however, it often gives a loud croaking <i>cuk cuk cuk</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systematics_and_taxonomy">Systematics and taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Like all egrets, it is a member of the heron <span>family</span>, <span>Ardeidae</span>. Traditionally classified with the <span>storks</span> in the <span>Ciconiiformes</span>, the Ardeidae are closer relatives of <span>pelicans</span> and belong in the <span>Pelecaniformes</span> instead. The great egret&#x2014;unlike the typical egrets&#x2014;does not belong to the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Egretta</span></i> but together with the great herons is today placed in <i><span>Ardea</span></i>. In the past, however, it was sometimes placed in <i>Egretta</i> or separated in a <span>monotypic</span> genus <i><b>Casmerodius</b></i>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>There are four <span>subspecies</span> in various parts of the world, which differ but little. Differences are bare part coloration in the breeding season and size; the largest <i>A. a. modesta</i> from Asia and <span>Australasia</span> some taxonomists consider a full species, the <span>eastern great egret</span> (<i>Ardea modesta</i>).:</p>

<p>The great egret is partially <span>migratory</span>, with <span>northern hemisphere</span> birds moving south from areas with colder winters. It breeds in <span>colonies</span> in trees close to large lakes with <span>reed beds</span> or other extensive <span>wetlands</span>. It builds a bulky stick nest.</p>
<p>The great egret is generally a very successful species with a large and expanding range. In <span>North America</span>, large numbers of great egrets were killed around the end of the 19th century so that their plumes could be used to decorate hats. Numbers have since recovered as a result of conservation measures. Its range has expanded as far north as southern <span>Canada</span>. However, in some parts of the <span>southern United States</span>, its numbers have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, it adapts well to human habitation and can be readily seen near wetlands and bodies of water in urban and suburban areas. In 1953, the great egret in flight was chosen as the symbol of the <span>National Audubon Society</span>, which was formed in part to prevent the killing of birds for their feathers.</p>
<p>The great egret is one of the species to which the <span>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</span> (AEWA) applies.</p>
<p>On 22 May 2012, it was announced a pair of great egrets were nesting in the UK for the first time at the <span>Shapwick Heath</span> nature reserve in <span>Somerset</span>. The species is a rare visitor to the UK and Ben Aviss of the <span>BBC</span> stated that the news could mean the UK's first great egret colony is established. The following week, Kevin Anderson of <span>Natural England</span> confirmed a great egret chick had hatched, making it a new breeding bird record for the UK. Anderson commented "We've definitely seen one chick stretching a wing just before the adult arrived and also after it left and we continue to monitor for more. The eggs of the great egret can hatch over a period of a few days so it may be that if there are other young on the nest they will be less developed and won't be visible yet."</p>

Spearing a fish</div>

</div>
<p>The great egret feeds in shallow water or drier habitats, feeding mainly on <span>fish</span>, <span>frogs</span>, small <span>mammals</span>, and occasionally small <span>reptiles</span> and <span>insects</span>, spearing them with its long, sharp bill most of the time by standing still and allowing the prey to come within its striking distance of its bill which it uses as a spear. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim.</p>
