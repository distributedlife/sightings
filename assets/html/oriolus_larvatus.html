<p>The <b>black-headed oriole</b> (<i>Oriolus larvatus</i>) is an <span>African</span> <span>passerine</span>. It has a very striking appearance with a bright yellow body, contrasting black head and flesh-coloured beak.</p>
<p>It breeds in much of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> from <span>Sudan</span> and <span>Ethiopia</span> in the north to South Africa in the south.</p>
<p>It inhabits dry tropical forests, especially <span>acacia</span> and broad-leaved woodlands, and dense shrubland areas, where it is more often heard than seen despite the brightness of its plumage.</p>
<p>The voice is a liquid-sounding warble, accompanied by imitations and whistles.</p>
<p>It forages in the canopy, feeding on small fruit as well as large insects. The young are fed mostly with caterpillars.</p>
