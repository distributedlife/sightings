Baikal Teal</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Baikal teal</b> (<i>Anas formosa</i>), also called the <b>bimaculate duck</b> or <b>squawk duck</b>, is a <span>dabbling duck</span> that breeds in eastern <span>Russia</span> and winters in <span>East Asia</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>At between 39 and 43 centimetres (15 and 17&#xA0;in), this duck is slightly larger and longer-tailed than the <span>common teal</span>. The breeding male is unmistakable, with a striking green <span>nape</span>, yellow and black <span>auriculars</span>, <span>neck</span>, and throat. It has a dark <span>crown</span>, and its <span>breast</span> is light brown with dark spots. It has long dropping dark <span>scapulars</span>, and its grey sides are set off on the front and rear with white bars..</p>
<p>The Baikal teal has a height from 11.75 to 15.75 inches and a weighs an average of 1 pound.</p>
<p>The female looks similar to a female <span>green-winged teal</span> but with a longer tail, and a distinctive white spot at the base of the bill and a white throat that angles to the back of the eye. She also has a distinct light eyebrow bordered by a darker crown. The underwing is similar to the Green-winged Teal also, but has a darker leading edge. The green <span>speculum</span> has an indistinct cinnamon-buff inner border. Some "females" have "bridle" markings on their faces, but it has been suggested that at least some of these bridled "females," if not all, are in fact juvenile males. The juvenile has a <span>plumage</span> similar to that of the female and can be distinguished from the Common Teal by the pale loral spot.</p>
<p>In non-breeding <span>(eclipse) plumage</span>, the drake looks more like the female, but plumage is a much richer reddish-brown (<span>rufous</span>) colour.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Molecular and behavioral data suggest that it has no close relatives among living ducks and should be placed in a distinct genus; it is possibly closest to such species as the <span>garganey</span> and the <span>northern shoveler</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It breeds within the forest zone of eastern <span>Siberia</span> from the <span>Yenisey</span> basin eastwards to <span>Kamchatka</span>, northern <span>Koryak</span>, eastern <span>Magadan Oblast</span>, northern <span>Khabarovsk Krai</span>, southeastern and northern <span>Sakha</span> east central <span>Irkutsk Oblast</span>, and northern <span>Krasnoyarsk Krai</span>. It is a <span>migratory</span> species, wintering in <span>South Korea</span>, <span>Japan</span>, <span>Taiwan</span>, northern and eastern <span>China</span>, from <span>Beijing</span> down the coast to the <span>Vietnam</span> border, and west to <span>Yunnan</span> then north to <span>Chongqing</span> and <span>Henan</span>.</p>
<p>It breeds in pools on the <span>tundra</span> edge and within swampy forests. In winter it is found on lowland fresh waters.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>This species is classified as <span>Least Concern</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span>, though it was classified as <span>Vulnerable</span> before 2011 due to hunting and destruction of its wintering wetland habitats. These threats remain, but the Baikal teal is recovering, with increased numbers of wintering birds and some increase in habitat area. Based on the numbers of Baikal teal counted wintering in South Korea, the global population is estimated to be around 1.07&#xA0;million individual adults around 2010, a major increase from the tens of thousands counted in the 1980s and few hundreds of thousands in the 2000s.</p>
