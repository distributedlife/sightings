<p>The <b>lanner falcon</b> (<i>Falco biarmicus</i>) is a medium-sized <span>bird of prey</span> that breeds in <span>Africa</span>, southeast <span>Europe</span> and just into <span>Asia</span>. It is mainly resident, but some <span>birds</span> <span>disperse</span> more widely after the breeding season.</p>

<p>It is a large <span>falcon</span>, at 43&#x2013;50&#xA0;cm length with a wingspan of 95&#x2013;105&#xA0;cm. European lanner falcons (<i>Falco biarmicus feldeggi</i>, also called <b>Feldegg's falcon</b>) have slate grey or brown-grey upperparts; most African <span>subspecies</span> are a paler blue grey above. The breast is streaked in northern birds, resembling greyish <span>saker falcons</span>, but the lanner has a reddish back to the head. Sexes are similar, but the browner young birds resemble saker falcons even more. However, sakers have a lighter top of the head and less clear head-side patterns. The lanner's call is a harsh "<i>wray-e</i>".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>The lanner falcon is a <span>bird</span> of open country and <span>savanna</span>. It usually hunts by horizontal pursuit, rather than the <span>peregrine falcon</span>'s stoop from a height, and takes mainly <span>bird</span> prey in flight. It lays 3&#x2013;4 <span>eggs</span> on a cliff ledge <span>nest</span>, or occasionally in an old stick nest in a <span>tree</span>.</p>
<p>This is presumably the oldest living <span>hierofalcon</span> species. Support for this assumption comes mainly from <span>biogeography</span> agreeing better with the confusing pattern of <span>DNA sequence</span> data in this case than in others. Nonetheless, there is rampant <span>hybridization</span> (see also <span>perilanner</span>) and incomplete <span>lineage sorting</span> which confounds the data to a massive extent; molecular studies with small <span>sample sizes</span> can simply not be expected to yield reliable conclusions in the entire hierofalcon group. In any case, the <span>radiation</span> of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons seems to have taken place in the <span>Eemian interglacial</span> at the start of the <span>Late Pleistocene</span>, a mere 130,000&#x2013;115,000 years ago; the lanner falcons would thus represent the lineage that became isolated in <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> at some time during the <span>Riss glaciation</span> (200,000 to 130,000 years ago) already.</p>
<p>They are bred in <span>captivity</span> for falconry; hybrids with the peregrine ("<span>perilanners</span>") are also often seen. Merret (1666) claimed that the "lanar" lived in <span>Sherwood Forest</span> and the <span>Forest of Dean</span> in <span>England</span>; such populations would seem to derive from escaped hunting birds of the nobility.</p>
<p>In the wild lanner falcon numbers are somewhat declining in Europe, though the species remains relatively common in parts of Africa.</p>
<p><span>Jackdaw</span> flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons, although larger flocks are more able to elude becoming prey.</p>
