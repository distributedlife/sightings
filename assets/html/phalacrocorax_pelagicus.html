<p>The <b>pelagic cormorant</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax pelagicus</i>), also known as <b>Baird's cormorant</b>, is a small member of the <span>cormorant</span> <span>family</span> Phalacrocoracidae. Analogous to other smallish cormorants, it is also called the <b>pelagic shag</b> occasionally. This <span>seabird</span> lives along the coasts of the northern <span>Pacific</span>; during winter it can also be found in the open <span>ocean</span>.</p>
<p>Many authors favor splitting up the "<span>wastebin genus</span>" <i>Phalacrocorax</i>. In this case, the pelagic cormorant would probably be placed in <i>Compsohalieus</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This is a smallish cormorant which measures 25 to 35&#xA0;in (64 to 89&#xA0;cm) in length, with a <span>wingspan</span> of about 3.3&#xA0;ft (1 meter) and a weight of 52&#x2013;86 oz (1,474&#x2013;2,438 g) when fully grown. Adults in nonbreeding plumage are all-black with a metallic <span>iridescence</span>. In breeding plumage they grow two short crests (one on top of the head and one at the <span>nape</span>), white <span>thighs</span>, and scattered white <span>filoplumes</span> on the head and neck. The long thin <span>bill</span> and the large feet with <span>all-webbed toes</span> are black throughout the year, while the patch of dark naked skin below the eye turns a vivid <span>magenta</span> in the breeding season.</p>
<p>Males and females do not differ in appearance, though the latter are a bit smaller. Immature birds lack iridescence and are dark brown, grading into slightly lighter brown on the underside.</p>
<p>The widely <span>sympatric</span> <span>red-faced cormorant</span> (<i>P. urile</i>) looks very similar. Breeding adults are easily told apart by the amount of naked facial skin, which does not noticeably extend beyond the eye in <i>P. pelagicus</i>, but extends to above the bill and above and behind the eye in <i>P. urile</i>; the latter species also has larger crests. Juveniles and nonbreeding adults of the two <span>species</span> are often indistinguishable even to trained observers when in mixed flocks, or if they cannot be observed up close. In the former case, the large naked face "mask" and light bill of <i>P. urile</i> can be easily recognized, in the latter case its larger size (though male pelagic cormorants can be as large as female red-faced cormorants). Unlike the red-faced cormorant, the present species usually calls out before taking off, particularly during the breeding season. In <span>courtship display</span>, nest material is typically torn and moved about (which <i>P. urile</i> might not do) and the males apparently do not bow their heads before the females as <i>P. urile</i> males do. Other North Pacific cormorants and shags are larger, with a thicker bill, and/or lack the white thighs in breeding plumage.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_ecology">Range and ecology</span></h2>
<p>The pelagic cormorant inhabits the shores and the <span>neritic</span> zone of the <span>North Pacific</span>. Its <span>North American</span> range extends from <span>Alaska</span> to the <span>Baja peninsula</span> in <span>Mexico</span>. It furthermore is found on the <span>Aleutian</span> and other <span>Bering Strait</span> islands, and from the <span>Russian Far East</span> <span>Chukchi Peninsula</span> via <span>Sakhalin</span> south to <span>Kamchatka</span>, and ultimately <span>Ky&#x16B;sh&#x16B;</span> (though not the rest of <span>Japan</span>). The <span>subarctic</span> <span>populations</span> are <span>migratory</span>, while the birds from <span>temperate</span> and <span>subtropical</span> regions only disperse locally after breeding, but even so Asian birds may reach <span>China</span> or <span>Korea</span>. <span>Vagrants</span> have been recorded in the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>On land, pelagic cormorants are rather clumsy and walk with the high-stepped waddling gait typical for all <span>Sulae</span> except <span>darters</span>; after landing they often scratch the ground, as is typical for cormorants. When they feel threatened, they will dart their bills at the intruder, and shake their heads and make a gargling noise. This bird forages by swimming to locate <span>prey</span>, then diving and going after it underwater, propelled by its feet and steering with the wings. It can dive as deep as 100&#xA0;ft (30&#xA0;m) to feed on or near the <span>seafloor</span>. Typical hunting grounds are sheltered <span>inlets</span> and <span>bays</span>; especially outside the breeding season they can also be seen fishing out at sea. They prefer to hunt in the vicinity of <span>kelp</span> beds or among rocks. Typical prey are smallish, bottom-living non-<span>schooling</span> <span>fishes</span>, such as <i><span>Ammodytes</span></i> <span>sand eels</span>, <span>sculpins</span> (Cottidae), <span>gunnels</span> (Pholidae) and <i><span>Sebastes</span></i> (<span>rockfish</span>). Apart from fish, small <span>crustaceans</span> &#x2013; in particular <span>shrimp</span> &#x2013; are also often eaten. It has been observed to join <span>mixed-species feeding flocks</span> going after schools of young <span>Pacific herrings</span> (<i>Clupea pallasii</i>). Like in all cormorants, due to their vestigial <span>uropygial gland</span> their plumage is not <span>waterproof</span>. Thus, the birds return to a safe place after foraging to <span>preen</span> and dry their feathers, typically adopting a spread-winged posture.</p>

<p>The pelagic cormorant breeds on <span>rocky shores</span> and islands. They do not form large <span>colonies</span>, but smaller groups may nest together. In some cases these birds alternate between two or three nesting sites in a region from one year to another. The nest is built at the cliff face, usually on ledges, less often in crevices or caves. The nest is built from stringy <span>plants</span>, such as <span>grasses</span> or <span>seaweed</span>, and held together by the birds' own <span>guano</span>. Once the birds have found a nest site they like, they tend to remain faithful to it for the rest of their lives. The nest is repaired and improved in each season if need be; it can thus grow up to 5&#xA0;ft (1.5 m) deep.</p>
<p>Males searching for a mate or bonding with their partner give an elaborate <span>courtship display</span>, as is typical for Sulae. Like all cormorants, this includes stretching the <span>gular sac</span> with the <span>hyoid bone</span> and repeated "yawning"; as in many but not all cormorants, the pelagic cormorant's display furthermore includes arching the neck and hopping, lifting the folded wings and rapidly fluttering them to show the white thigh patches. During the yawning display, the head is thrown back and calls are given which differ between males and females; when the birds land, males and females give an identical call. Otherwise, the displays are given in silence.</p>
<p>The <span>clutch</span> is generally between two and five <span>eggs</span>, most often three or four, but clutches of up to seven eggs have been recorded. <span>Incubation</span> lasts for 3 weeks to one month. At hatching, the young weigh somewhat more than an ounce (35&#xA0;g) and are naked, but they soon grow <span>sooty</span>-gray <span>down feathers</span>. In normal years, all young of a typical clutch may be raised successfully, but less than four rarely <span>fledge</span>. On the other hand, during unfavorable phases of the <span>Pacific decadal oscillation</span>, most pairs manage to raise only two young at most. They reach <span>sexual maturity</span> at two years of age, and a maximum age of almost eighteen years has been recorded in the wild.</p>
<p>This numerous and widespread species is not considered threatened by the <span>IUCN</span>. The bulk of its population is found in the relatively inaccessible waters of the Bering Sea region; about 50,000 each breed in the Kuril Islands, the Bering Sea islands, and the U.S. state of Alaska and its offshore islands (including the Aleuts). About 25,000 breed down the Pacific coast of North America, some 60% of which are found in California. Local populations may be all but wiped out temporarily by <span>oil spills</span>, and on a larger scale competition with <span>gillnet</span> fisheries and drowning in such nets is putting a limit to its stocks.</p>
<p>The <span>acanthocephalan</span> parasite <i><span>Andracantha phalacrocoracis</span></i> was described from this cormorant.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>The cormorant <span>family</span> Phalacrocoracidae has traditionally been included &#x2013; like all other <span>birds</span> with fully webbed toes &#x2013; in the <span>Pelecaniformes</span>. But the namesake <span>pelicans</span> (Pelecanidae) are actually closer relatives of <span>storks</span> (Ciconiidae) than of cormorants. Hence, it has been proposed to separate the Phalacrocoracidae and relatives as <span>order</span> <span>Phalacrocoraciformes</span>.</p>

The largely <span>sympatric</span> <span>red-faced cormorant</span> (<i>P. urile</i>, shown here in breeding plumage) is the pelagic cormorant's <span>sister species</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This <span>species</span> is here placed in the catch-all <span>genus</span> <i><span>Phalacrocorax</span></i>. Modern authors generally are reserved about uniting all cormorants in one "<span>wastebin genus</span>", but no general revision has been published that has any <span>phylogenetic</span> merit. Though it was proposed to place the pelagic cormorant in <i>Stictocarbo</i> for example, this is quite certainly wrong, as the present species is by no means closely related to the <span>spotted shag</span> (<i>P. punctatus</i>), the <span>type species</span> of <i>Stictocarbo</i>. Similarly, <i>Leucocarbo</i> would refer to the group around the <span>imperial shag</span> (<i>P. atriceps</i>) complex, which occurs on the opposite end of the Earth from <i>P. pelagicus</i>. The supposed "cliff shag" <span>subfamily</span> Leucocarboninae is entirely <span>paraphyletic</span> cannot be accepted as originally circumscribed. If subfamilies are to be accepted in the Phalacrocoracidae, the pelagic shag and its relatives would go in the Phalacrocoracinae like most <span>Northern Hemisphere</span> cormorants and shags, while Leucocarboninae would include mainly <span>Southern Hemisphere</span> <span>taxa</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, the correct <span>genus</span> name for the pelagic cormorant, if <i>Phalacrocorax</i> is to be split up, would be <i>Compsohalieus</i>. This name would apply to the group around its <span>type species</span> (<span>Brandt's cormorant</span>, <i>P. penicillatus</i>). This is a <span>North Pacific</span> <span>clade</span>, which apart from Brandt's and the pelagic cormorant also includes the <span>red-faced cormorant</span> (<i>P. urile</i>) and probably also the <span>extinct</span> <span>spectacled cormorant</span> (<i>P. perspicillatus</i>). They all have black feet, and in breeding plumage grow white <span>filoplumes</span> on the head and/or neck, and usually also two head-crests and white <span>thigh</span> patches like the present species does. They also share the back-thrown head during the "yawning" and the rapid wing-flutter in <span>courtship display</span>. Among the <i>Compsohalieus</i> group, the red-faced cormorant is the <span>sister species</span> of <i>P. pelagicus</i>. Apart from looking almost alike, these two species also "yawn" many times in a row instead of giving the display just once, twist their bodies before taking flight during courtship, and the male and female post-landing calls are identical. The point-and-gargle response to threats is also an <span>apomorphy</span> of these two species.</p>
<p>Its traditional <span>scientific name</span> is the literal <span>Latinized</span> <span>Ancient Greek</span> equivalent of the common name: <i>Phalacrocorax</i> is an ancient term for cormorants; literally, it means "bald <span>raven</span>", from <i>falakr&#xF3;s</i> (&#x3C6;&#x1FB6;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3CC;&#x3C2;, "bald") + <i>k&#xF3;rax</i> (&#x3BA;&#x3CC;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;, "raven"). <i>Pelagicus</i> is &#x2013; like the <span>English</span> <span>loanword</span> "<span>pelagic</span>" &#x2013; derived from <i>pel&#xE1;gios</i> (&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x1FB6;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;, "of the open seas"). <i>Compsohalieus</i>, meanwhile, means "sleek fisher"; it derives from <i>komps&#xF3;s</i> (&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C8;&#x3CC;&#x3C2;, "elegant" or "sleek") + <i>(h)alieus</i> (&#x1F07;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B5;&#x3CD;&#x3C2;, "fisherman").</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Two <span>subspecies</span> are generally recognized. The difference between them is slight and generally agrees with <span>Bergmann's Rule</span>:</p>

<p>The <b>Amchitka cormorant</b> or <b>Kenyon's shag</b> (<i><b>P. kenyoni</b></i>) is a supposed <span>species</span> that was presumed to be closely related to the pelagic cormorant. It was described from the bones of three individuals snared in fishing nets in the late 1950s at <span>Constantine Harbor</span> on <span>Amchitka</span> in the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>. The <span>specific name</span> <i>kenyoni</i> honors <span>USFWS</span> <span>biologist</span> Karl W. Kenyon, who collected the <span>type specimen</span> <span>USNM</span> 431164 on 22 February 1959. Some bones from <span>prehistoric</span> <span>middens</span> on Amchitka were also attributed to this <span>taxon</span>. As distinctive cormorants were never seen alive in recent years on Amchitka, it was conjectured by some that Kenyon's shag might have gone <span>extinct</span> in the 1960s&#x2013;1970s (<span>marine pollution</span> and <span>overfishing</span> would be possible reasons).</p>
<p>However, a subsequent analysis of a larger number of comparison specimens of the pelagic cormorant &#x2013; mainly from birds that fell victim to the <span>Exxon Valdez oil spill</span> &#x2013; determined that the bones were attributable to small females of the latter species, and that their apparent distinctness was due to the original <span>canonical analysis</span> being distorted by insufficient specimens. The researchers also found that contrary to what was generally assumed, pelagic cormorants from the Aleutians were generally small birds &#x2013; as opposed to western Alaskan individuals, which are usually very large. If the Aleutian population were to be considered a distinct <span>subspecies</span>, the name <i>kenyoni</i> would apply. Verification of subspecies status would require <span>DNA sequence</span> analyses however, since the differences in <span>morphology</span> are not large and there is much variation between individuals.</p>
<p>In 2003, during an USFWS survey three small pelagic cormorants whose bills appeared to be red were noted at <span>Karab Cove</span> on <span>Agattu Island</span>. It may be that these were <i>kenyoni</i>, but whether the bill color distinguishes the presumed subspecies or whether it is due to a simple <span>mutation</span> has not been determined. The large birds from the <span>Prince William Sound</span> region were formerly called <i>P. p. robustus</i>, but are not considered distinct today. Since there appear to be at least two recognizable and <span>allopatric</span> size groups in the northern subspecies alone, more research is clearly necessary.</p>
