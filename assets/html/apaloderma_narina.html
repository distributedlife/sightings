<p>The <b>Narina Trogon</b> (<i>Apaloderma narina</i>) is a medium-sized (up to 34&#xA0;cm long), largely green forest bird in the <span>Trogonidae</span> family. It is the most widespread and catholic in habitat choice of three <span>Apaloderma</span> <span>trogons</span>. The species name is <span>Khoikhoi</span> in origin, believed to be named after <span>Narina</span>, the mistress of the French <span>ornithologist</span> <span>Fran&#xE7;ois Le Vaillant</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>Both sexes have vivid, gingery green upperpart plumage. The tail feathers have a metallic blue-green gloss. The outer three <span>rectices</span> on each side are tipped and fringed white, giving the undertail of perched birds a characteristic white appearance (compare <span>Bar-tailed Trogon</span>). The wing coverts are a grizzled grey, and <span>remiges</span> mostly colourless grey.</p>
<p>The male especially, has bright <span>amaranth</span> red underside plumage and bare, green <span>gape</span> and eye flanges. The female has brown face and chest plumage, blue skin orbiting the eyes and duller red plumage below. Immature birds resemble females, but have distinct white tips to the <span>tertials</span> (inner wing), and less distinct gape and eye flanges.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The species has a large range in Africa, inhabiting lowland to highland, valley and <span>riparian forests</span>, from tropical to temperate regions, those occurring in highlands dispersing seasonally to lower levels. It is found from <span>Sierra Leone</span> to <span>Ethiopia</span>, and <span>east Africa</span> to eastern and southern <span>South Africa</span>. Due to its wide range and varied habitat choice, the Narina Trogon is considered to be a species of least conservation concern.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits">Habits</span></h2>
<p>The diet consists mainly of insects and small invertebrates as well as rodents and small reptiles. The call is a grating, low repeated hoot, given by males only, in defending territory or attracting mates. The male's bare, blue-green throat patch is expanded when calling and both sexes may fluff out the breast feathers in display. They nest in a <span>tree hollow</span> in which both sexes incubate or brood.</p>
