<p>The <b>yellow-billed kite</b> (<i>Milvus aegyptius</i>) is the <span>Afrotropic</span> counterpart of the <span>black kite</span> (<i>Milvus migrans</i>), of which it is most often considered a <span>subspecies</span>. However, recent <span>DNA</span> studies suggest that the yellow-billed kite differs significantly from black kites in the <span>Eurasian</span> <span>clade</span>, and should be considered as a separate, <span>allopatric</span> species.</p>
<p>There are two subspecies: <i>M. a. parasitus</i>, found throughout most of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span> (including <span>Madagascar</span>), except for the <span>Congo Basin</span> (with intra-African migrations) and <i>M. a. aegyptius</i> of <span>Egypt</span>, south-west <span>Arabia</span> and the <span>Horn of Africa</span> (which disperses south during the non-breeding season).</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>As suggested by its name, the yellow-billed kite is easily recognized by its entirely yellow bill, unlike that of the <span>black kite</span> (which is present in Africa as a visitor during the <span>North Hemisphere</span> winter). However, immature yellow-billed kites resemble the black kites of the corresponding age.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>It is mostly an intra-African breeding migrant, present in <span>Southern Africa</span> July&#x2013;March and sometimes as late as May. It is generally common.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_feeding">Habitat and feeding</span></h2>
<p>They are found in almost all habitats, including parks in suburbia, but rare in the arid <span>Namib</span> and <span>Karoo</span>. They feed on a wide range of small vertebrates and insects, much of which is scavenged.</p>
