<p>The <b>northern giant petrel</b> (<i>Macronectes halli</i>), also known as the <b>Hall's giant petrel</b>, is a large predatory <span>seabird</span> of the southern oceans. Its distribution overlaps broadly with the similar <span>southern giant petrel</span>, though it overall is centred slightly further north.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The northern giant petrel along with its counterpart, the southern giant petrel, make up the <i><span>Macronectes</span></i> genus. They come from the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>, which are referred to as tube-nosed seabirds, due to their unique nose structure. All tube-noses have tubular nostrils, and all <span>Procellariidae</span> have the openings on top of the upper portion of the <span>bill</span>. Procellariiformes also have between seven and nine distinct horny plates for their bill, and <span>petrels</span> have one of these plates that form the hooked portion of their upper bill called their <span>maxillary unguis</span>. They produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a concentrated saline solution from their nostrils.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Macronectes giganteus</i> can be broken down as <i>makros</i> a <span>Greek</span> word meaning "long" or "large" and <i>n&#x113;kt&#x113;s</i> meaning "swimmer". <i>Northern giant petrel</i> starts with "northern" referring to their habitat being further north than their counterpart the <span>southern giant petrel</span>, and "petrel" refers to <span>Saint Peter</span> and from the story of him walking on water, which refers to how they run on top of the water as they are getting airborne.</p>

<p>The northern giant petrel averages 90&#xA0;cm (35&#xA0;in) in length. Its <span>plumage</span> consists of grey-brown body with lighter coloured forehead, sides of face, and chin. Its <span>bill</span> is between 90&#x2013;105&#xA0;mm (3.5&#x2013;4.1&#xA0;in) long and is pinkish yellow with a brown tip, and its eyes are grey. The juvenile of this species is completely dark brown and lightens as it ages. It can be differentiated from the similar coloured <span>southern giant petrel</span> by the top of the bill, which on the southern is green.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The northern giant petrel feeds mainly on <span>carrion</span> from <span>penguins</span> and <span>pinnipeds</span>, as well as <span>krill</span>, <span>offal</span>, <span>cephalopods</span>, and discarded fish and waste from ships. During the breeding season, males eat more carrion than females with the females feeding on <span>pelagic</span> sources.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Birds start breeding at an average age of ten years, and breed on islands in <span>colonies</span>, which they share with the <span>southern giant petrel</span>. They breed six weeks earlier than their counterpart though.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>They are <span>pelagic</span> and fly throughout the <span>Southern Oceans</span> north of the <span>Antarctic Convergence Zone</span>, and north through <span>Chile</span>, <span>Argentina</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, and half of <span>Australia</span>. They nest on islands with the <span>South Georgia</span> group with 4,500 pairs. They also nest on some of the <span>Chatham Islands</span>, <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Macquarie Island</span> and others. Their overall occurrence range is 82,600,000&#xA0;km (31,900,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi).</p>

Immature birds are more common at higher latitudes.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Overall their population stands at between 17,000 and 21,000 mature birds, based on a 2001 estimate. This number has been increasing over the last two decades even though it was forecast to decrease. This increase has allowed the <span>IUCN</span> to downgrade them from <span>near threatened</span> to <span>least concern</span>. Recent surveys have shown that most locations are increasing in numbers except for the <span>Crozet Islands</span>. This is probably due to increases in fish waste, better control on <span>longline fishing</span>, and more <span>carrion</span> from <span>fur seals</span>.</p>
<p>Currently this bird is listed on <span>CMS Appendix II</span> and <span>ACAP Annex 1</span>. Future plans are to maintain the surveys and counting of individuals, researching movement and migrations, continuing the trend of lowering the <span>bycatch</span> deaths by current means and if needed newer measures through <span>CCAMLR</span>, <span>CMS</span>, and <span>FAO</span>.</p>
