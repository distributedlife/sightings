<p>The <b>Eurasian golden oriole</b> or simply <b>golden oriole</b> (<i>Oriolus oriolus</i>) is the only member of the <span>oriole</span> family of <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> breeding in northern hemisphere temperate regions. It is a summer <span>migrant</span> in <span>Europe</span> and western <span>Asia</span> and spends the winter season in central and southern <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Golden orioles have an extremely large range with large populations that are apparently stable. Therefore, they are evaluated as <span>least concern</span> by <span>BirdLife International</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>Until a few years ago this species was treated as being conspecific with the <span>Indian golden oriole</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h3>
<p>The name "oriole" was first used in the 18th century and is an adaptation of the scientific <span>Latin</span> genus name, which is derived from the Classical Latin "aureolus" meaning <i>golden</i>. Various forms of "oriole" have existed in <span>Romance languages</span> since the 12th and 13th centuries. <span>Albertus Magnus</span> used the Latin form <i>oriolus</i> in about 1250 and erroneously stated that it was <span>onomatopoeic</span> because of the golden oriole's song. In medieval England its name, derived from the song, was the <i>woodwele</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The male is striking in the typical oriole black and yellow plumage, but the female is a drabber green bird. Orioles are shy, and even the male is remarkably difficult to see in the dappled yellow and green leaves of the canopy. In flight they look somewhat like a <span>thrush</span>, strong and direct with some shallow dips over longer distances. The <span>New World orioles</span> are similar in appearance to the Oriolidae, but are <span>icterids</span> unrelated to the Old World birds.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The breeding range of this species spans from <span>Portugal</span>, <span>Spain</span> and <span>France</span> across the <span>United Kingdom</span> and <span>Scandinavia</span> to <span>Poland</span>, <span>Russia</span>, the <span>Balkans</span>, <span>Turkey</span> and <span>West Asia</span> to the <span>Caucasus</span> up to <span>Mongolia</span> and <span>China</span>. They winter in central and southern <span>Africa</span>. They generally migrate during the night, but may travel during the day in the spring migration. During the fall migration they migrate via the Eastern <span>Mediterranean</span> where they feed on fruit; they are often considered a pest in this region because of this.</p>
<p>The Eurasian golden oriole inhabits a range of habitats. In Western Europe they prefer open broadleaf forests and plantations, copses, riverine forest, orchards, large gardens; in Eastern Europe they may inhabit more continuous forest as well as mixed or coniferous forests. They generally avoid treeless habitats but may forage there. In their wintering habitat they are found in semi-arid to humid woodland, tall forests, riverine forest, woodland/savanna mosaic and savanna.</p>

</div>
<p>They feed on insects and fruit. They build neat nests in <span>tree forks</span> and lay 3&#x2013;6 eggs. Their call is a screech like a <span>jay</span>, but the song is a beautiful fluting <i>weela-wee-ooo</i> or <i>or-iii-ole</i>, unmistakable once heard.</p>
