<p>The <b>Black-fronted Bushshrike</b> (<i>Telophorus nigrifrons</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of the <span>bushshrike</span> family, Malaconotidae. It inhabits <span>forests</span> in <span>Southern</span> and <span>Eastern</span> <span>Africa</span>. It forms a <span>superspecies</span> with the <span>Many-colored Bushshrike</span> (<i>T. multicolor</i>) and the two are sometimes considered to be a single species.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is 18-19 centimetres long. It is variable in appearance and has several different colour <span>morphs</span>. All birds have green upperparts, grey crown and upper back, yellow tip to the tail and dark <span>bill</span> and legs. The orange morph has a black mask and forehead and orange underparts, shading to yellow under the tail. The red morph is similar but redder on the throat and breast with yellow on the belly and undertail-coverts. The buff form has buff underparts and a pale throat. The black morph has an entirely black face, forehead, throat and breast and green belly and undertail-coverts. Females are duller than the males with less black on the forehead. <span>Juvenile</span> birds have buffish underparts with dark barring and yellow edges to the wing-feathers. The <span>song</span> includes repeated bell-like phrases. Pairs often duet together.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It has a patchy distribution and is restricted to <span>montane forests</span> in many areas. It forages in the canopy and middle levels of the forest and joins <span>mixed-species feeding flocks</span> outside the breeding season. There are three subspecies: <i>T. n. nigrifrons</i> occurs from central <span>Kenya</span> southwards through <span>Tanzania</span> to northern <span>Malawi</span>. <i>T. n. manningi</i> is found from the south-eastern part of the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> to northern <span>Zambia</span>. <i>T. n. sandgroundi</i> occurs in southern Malawi, <span>Mozambique</span>, eastern <span>Zimbabwe</span> and north-eastern South Africa.</p>
