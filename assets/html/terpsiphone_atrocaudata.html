<p>The <b>Japanese paradise flycatcher</b> (<i>Terpsiphone atrocaudata</i>), also called the <b>black paradise flycatcher</b>, is a medium-sized <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. It was previously classified with the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family Muscicapidae, but the paradise-flycatchers, monarch flycatchers and <span>Australasian fantails</span> are now normally grouped with the <span>drongos</span> in the family <span>Dicruridae</span>, which has most of its members in <span>Australasia</span> and tropical southern <span>Asia</span>.</p>
<p>The Japanese paradise flycatcher is mainly migratory and breeds in shady mature deciduous or evergreen broadleaf forest of Japan (southern Honsh&#x16B;, Shikoku, Kyushu and the Nansei Shoto islands), South Korea, Taiwan (including Lanyu island) and the far north Philippines. It is a non-breeding visitor to mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Sumatra, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Habitat: In <span>Jeju-do</span> of <span>South Korea</span>, <span>Gotjawal Forest</span>, a forest formed on a rocky area of <span>volcanic</span> <span>AA Lava</span>, is one of the important breeding sites of Japanese paradise flycatcher</p>
<p>There are three subspecies, the nominate <i>T. a. atrocaudata</i> which breeds through most of Japanese/Korean range, <i>T. a. illex</i> which is resident in the Ryukyu Islands, and <i>T. a. periophthalmica</i> restricted to Lanyu Island off southeast Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Japanese paradise flycatcher is similar in appearance to the <span>Asian paradise flycatcher</span> but slightly smaller. Mature males have a black hood with a purplish-blue gloss which shades into blackish-grey on the chest. The underparts are off-white to white. The mantle, back, wings and rump are plain dark chestnut. The tail has extremely long black central feathers, which are shorter in immature males. Unlike the Asian paradise flycatcher there is no white morph. The female resembles the male but is duller and darker brown on the chestnut areas. It has black legs and feet, a large black eye with a blue eye-ring, and a short blue bill.</p>
<p>The song is rendered in Japanese as <i>tsuki-hi-hoshi, hoi-hoi-hoi</i>, which translates to <i>Moon-Sun-Stars</i> and gives the Japanese name of the bird &#x30B5;&#x30F3;&#x30B3;&#x30A6;&#x30C1;&#x30E7;&#x30A6; (&#x4E09;&#x5149;&#x9CE5;) <i>sank&#x14D;ch&#x14D;</i> (literally, bird of three lights, i.e. moon, sun, star, from <i>san</i> three + <i>k&#x14D;</i> lights + <i>ch&#x14D;</i> bird).</p>
<p>A recent survey detected a steep decline in part of the Japanese breeding population which has presumably occurred because of forest loss and degradation in its winter range.</p>
