<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Its natural <span>habitats</span> are subtropical or tropical dry <span>forests</span>, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, dry <span>savanna</span>, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry <span>shrubland</span>, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, <span>arable land</span>, pastureland, rural gardens, <span>urban areas</span>, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.</p>
<p>These rats associate closely with humans, and are commonly found in and around African villages.</p>
<p>In 1972, the Natal multimammate mouse was found to be the natural host of the <span>Lassa fever virus</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Domestication">Domestication</span></h2>
<p>The Natal multimammate rat is currently being bred in the US and Canada as a replacement food source for reptiles, replacing the brown rat as a viable food source for picky eaters. It is also recognized as one of the natural food sources for ball pythons. They are also being used for stomach cancer research, among other ailments. Europeans have begun breeding them for companion animal use, namely in Germany and England. This trend is also catching, slowly, in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>They thrive in small breeding colonies, but chew on anything they can reach. So regular rat rack systems do not work, 10 gallon glass fish tanks work best. Also glass water bottles are needed. They have litters of 10-20 babies monthly, and reach sexual maturity at around three months of age. Even with regular handling they tend to stay wild in nature and aggressive towards humans and other animals. There life span is only around two years.</p>
