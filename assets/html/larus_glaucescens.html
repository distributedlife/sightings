<p>The <b>glaucous-winged gull</b> (<i>Larus glaucescens</i>) is a large, white-headed <span>gull</span> residing from the western coast of <span>Alaska</span> to the coast of <span>Washington</span>. It also breeds on the northwest coast of Alaska, in the summertime. During non-breeding seasons they can be found along the coast of <span>California</span>. It is a close relative of the <span>western gull</span> and frequently hybridizes with it, resulting in identification problems&#x2014;particularly in the <span>Puget Sound</span> area. This species also hybridizes regularly with the <span>herring gull</span> in Alaska. Both hybrid combinations resemble the <span>Thayer's gull</span>. Glaucous-winged gulls are thought to live about 15 years. An adult bird returned to Sea World in San Diego each winter for 17 years. One individual, notable because he had only one leg, lived at least 30.</p>
<p>The glaucous-winged gull is rarely found far from <span>saltwater</span>. It is a large bird, being close in size to the <span>herring gull</span>, with which it has a superficial resemblance, and the <span>western gull</span>, to which it is likely most closely related. It measures 50&#x2013;68&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;27&#xA0;in) in length and 120&#x2013;150&#xA0;cm (47&#x2013;59&#xA0;in), with a body mass of 730&#x2013;1,690&#xA0;g (1.61&#x2013;3.73&#xA0;lb). It weighs around 1,010&#xA0;g (2.23&#xA0;lb) on average. Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 39.2 to 48&#xA0;cm (15.4 to 18.9&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 4.6 to 6.4&#xA0;cm (1.8 to 2.5&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 5.8 to 7.8&#xA0;cm (2.3 to 3.1&#xA0;in). It has a white head, neck, breast, and belly, a white tail, and pearly-gray wings and back. The term <i><span>glaucous</span></i> describes its colouration. The ends of its wings are white-tipped. Its legs are pink and the beak is yellow with a red <span>subterminal</span> spot. The forehead is somewhat flat. During the winter, the head and nape appears dusky, and the subterminal spot becomes dark. Young birds are brown or gray with black beaks, and take four years to reach full plumage.</p>

Glaucous-winged gull, juvenile</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The glaucous-winged gull nests in the summer, and each pair produces two or three chicks which <span>fledge</span> at six weeks.</p>
<p>It feeds along the coast, scavenging for dead or weak animals, fish, <span>mussels</span> and scraps. Its cry is a low-pitched "kak-kak-kak" or "wow", or a more high-pitched wailing.</p>
<p>It is an exceptionally rare vagrant to the <span>Western Palearctic</span> region, with records from <span>Morocco</span>, the <span>Canary Islands</span> and, most recently, from <span>Britain</span> in the winters of 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. The 2008/2009 record was from Saltholme Pools, Cleveland, and attracted hundreds of <span>twitchers</span>.</p>
