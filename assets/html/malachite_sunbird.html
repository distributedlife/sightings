<p>The <b>Malachite Sunbird</b> (<i>Nectarinia famosa</i>) is a small nectivorous bird found from the highlands of Ethiopia southwards to South Africa.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The sunbirds are a group of small <span>Old World</span> <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span>, and are placed within the family <span>Nectariniidae</span>, which is found across Africa, the Middle East and into South-east Asia. Also called Green Sugarbird.</p>
<p>The Malchite Sunbird has two subspecies. The nominate <i>N. f. famosa</i> occurs mainly in <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Lesotho</span> and western <span>Swaziland</span>, although its range just extends into southern <span>Namibia</span> and <span>Zimbabwe</span>. <i>N. f. cupreonitens</i> breeds in the highlands from Ethiopia south to northern <span>Mozambique</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>The breeding male Malachite Sunbird, which has very long central tail feathers, is 25&#xA0;cm long, and the shorter-tailed female 15&#xA0;cm. The adult male is metallic green when breeding, with blackish-green wings with small yellow pectoral patches. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the male's upperparts are brown apart from the green wings and tail, the latter retaining the elongated feathers. The underparts in eclipse plumage are yellow, flecked with green.</p>
<p>The female has brown upperparts and dull yellow underparts with some indistinct streaking on the breast. Her tail is square-ended. The juvenile resembles the female.</p>

Female feeding</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This large <span>sunbird</span> is found in hilly <span>fynbos</span> (including <span>protea</span> stands as well as areas with <span>aloes</span>) and cool montane and coastal scrub, up to 2,800m altitude in South Africa. It also occurs in parks and gardens (often nesting within those located in the Highveld). It is resident, but may <span>move</span> downhill in winter.</p>
<p>This species, like most sunbirds, feed mainly on <span>nectar</span>, although they will also take <span>insects</span>, especially when feeding young. This sunbird may hunt in a similar manner to a flycatcher, hawking for insect prey from a perch.</p>
<p>Most sunbird species can take <span>nectar</span> by hovering like a <span>hummingbird</span>, but usually perch to feed most of the time. As a fairly large sunbird, the Malachite Sunbird is no exception. They have long thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to nectar feeding. Some plant species from which Malachite Sunbirds feed include many <i>Aloe</i> species, such as <i><span>Aloe broomii</span></i>, <i><span>Aloe ferox</span></i> and <i><span>Aloe arborescens</span></i>, and <i>Protea</i> species, such as <i><span>Protea roupelliae</span></i> as well as various other bird-pollinated plants such as <i><span>Leonotis</span></i> and <i><span>Strelitzia</span></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding_and_behaviour">Breeding and behaviour</span></h2>
<p>This species is monogamous. The oval nest is usually suspended, as with most sunbirds, or built in a bush. The female incubates one to three dark-blotched greenish eggs for two weeks. The chicks are fed by both parents until fledging; they will continue to return to the nest to roost. The Malachite Sunbird is often double-brooded, but may be <span>parasitised</span> by <span>Klaas's Cuckoo</span> or <span>Red-chested Cuckoo</span>. It is territorial and aggressive when nesting, but highly gregarious when not breeding, forming flocks of more than 1000 birds.</p>
<p>The call is a loud <i>tseep-tseep</i>, and the male Malachite Sunbird has a twittering song, often accompanied by pointing its head upward and displaying the yellow pectoral tufts with its wings half open. Males also have an elaborate display flight.</p>
