<p>The <b>east coast akalat</b> or <b>Gunning's robin</b> (<i>Sheppardia gunningi</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> which can be found in the east of <span>Africa</span> from <span>Kenya</span> to <span>Mozambique</span>, and is named after <span>J. W. B. Gunning</span>.</p>
<p>This species is a <span>forest</span>-dwelling insectivorous bird related to the small <span>Old World flycatchers</span> commonly known as <span>chats</span>; like these, it was formerly placed with the thrushes (<span>Turdidae</span>).</p>
<p>The east coast akalat is affected by <span>habitat loss</span>. Having turned out to be more common than previously believed, it is downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened in the 2007 <span>IUCN Red List</span>.</p>
