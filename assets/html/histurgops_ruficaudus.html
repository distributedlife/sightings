<p>The <b>Rufous-tailed Weaver</b> (<i>Histurgops ruficaudus</i>) is a <span>species</span> of <span>songbird</span> found in <span>East Africa</span>. Despite its name, it is placed in the <span>sparrow</span> <span>family</span> (Passeridae).</p>
<p>It is a quite unusual sparrow species, and was included in the <span>weaver</span> family (Ploceidae) by many authors even after the other Old World sparrows were separated from the weavers proper, hence its common name. Due to its distant position among the Old World sparrows, it is placed in the <span>monotypic</span> genus <i><b>Histurgops</b></i>.</p>
<p>It is an <span>endemic</span> breeder in <span>Tanzania</span>, but vagrants occur in <span>Kenya</span> too.</p>
