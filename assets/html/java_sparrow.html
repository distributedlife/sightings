<p>The <b>Java sparrow</b> (<i>Lonchura oryzivora</i>), also known as <b>Java finch</b>, <b>Java rice sparrow</b> or <b>Java rice bird</b>, is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. This <span>estrildid finch</span> is a resident breeding bird in <span>Java</span>, <span>Bali</span> and <span>Bawean</span> in <span>Indonesia</span>. It is a popular cagebird, and has been introduced in a large number of other countries. Some taxonomists place this and the <span>Timor Sparrow</span> in their own <span>genus</span> <i>Padda</i>.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Java sparrow is about 15&#x2013;17&#xA0;cm in length from the beak to its tip of tail <span>feathers</span>. The adult is unmistakable, with its grey upperparts and breast, pink belly, white-cheeked black head, red eye-ring, pink feet and thick red <span>bill</span>.</p>
<p>Both sexes are similar. Immature birds have brown upperparts and pale brown underparts, and a plain head. Very young birds have a black beak with a pink base.</p>
<p>The call is a <i>chip</i>, and the song is a rapid series of call notes <i>chipchipchipchipchipchip</i>.</p>
<p>The Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora / Lonchura oryzivora) might be considered a Lonchura species according to both the BI and ML trees. This is a Estrildinae bird; Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Java sparrow is a very gregarious bird which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open grassland and cultivation, and was formerly a pest in <span>rice</span> fields, hence its <span>scientific name</span>. The <span>nest</span> is constructed in a tree or building, and up to eight <span>eggs</span> are laid.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats">Threats</span></h2>
<p>The Java sparrow is considered to be a serious agricultural pest of rice. Due to ongoing habitat loss and hunting in some areas, the Java sparrow is now uncommon in its native range. It is evaluated as <span>Vulnerable</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species and is listed on Appendix II of <span>CITES</span>.</p>

<p>The Java sparrow was introduced in the Indian subcontinent, but it failed to become a successful resident on the Indian mainland although it has established a breeding population around <span>Colombo</span>, <span>Sri Lanka</span>. In the United States there a breeding population on several of the Hawaiian Islands, especially Oahu.</p>
<p>In the Caribbean, the Java sparrow was introduced to <span>Puerto Rico</span> where it is fairly common near <span>San Juan</span>. It has also been sighted in <span>Jamaica</span>, but is not known to occur on any of the other islands. It was also introduced to <span>Christmas Island</span>, off the coast of <span>Western Australia</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aviculture">Aviculture</span></h2>
<p>The Java sparrow has been a popular cage bird in Asia for centuries, first in Ming Dynasty China and then in Japan from the 17th century, frequently appearing in Japanese paintings and prints. Meiji-era writer <span>Natsume Soseki</span> wrote an essay about his pet Java sparrow. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Java sparrow was one of the most popular cage birds in the United States until its import was banned. Today it remains illegal to possess in California because of a perceived threat to agriculture, although rice-dependent Asian countries like China, Taiwan and Japan have not regulated the bird.</p>
<p>In Asia the Java sparrow is most often raised almost from birth by human breeders and owners, and they become very tame and attached to humans. As such, they can be normally kept in relatively small cages, but let out for indoor exercise without their attempting to escape. In captivity, a variety of colorations have been bred, including white, silver/opal, fawn/isabel, pastel, cream and agate (which currently is rare within Europe captive specimens) along with the pied Java sparrow (called the "sakura buncho" in Japan).</p>
