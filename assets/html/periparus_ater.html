<p>The <b>coal tit</b> (<i>Periparus ater</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the <span>tit</span> <span>family</span> <span>Paridae</span>. It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout <span>temperate</span> to <span>subtropical</span> <span>Eurasia</span> and northern <span>Africa</span>. The <span>black-crested tit</span> is now usually included in this <span>species</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</span></h2>
<p>This species was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his 1758 edition of <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i>. Linnaeus' primary reference was his earlier <i>Fauna Svecica</i>, whose cumbersome pre-<span>binomial</span> name <i>Parus capite nigro: vertice albo, dorso cinereo, pectore albo</i> ("black-headed tit with white nape, ash-grey back, white breast") became the much simpler yet no less unequivocal <i>Parus ater</i>. This name &#x2013; meaning "dusky-black tit" &#x2013; was simply adopted from older <span>ornithological</span> textbooks, ultimately going back to <span>Conrad Gessner</span>'s 1555 <i><span>Historiae animalium</span></i>. Linnaeus' description was essentially the slightly rephrased species name from <i>Fauna Svecica</i>: <i>P[arus] capite nigro, dorso cinereo, occipite pectoreque albo.</i> &#x2013; "a black-headed tit, with ash-grey back, and white back of the head and breast." He gave no <span>type locality</span> except "Europe", but his original description refers to the population inhabiting <span>Sweden</span> (which is consequently included in the <span>nominate subspecies</span> today).</p>

The colorful <span>great tit</span> (<i>Parus major</i>) with its bold wing-stripe. Before <span>binomial nomenclature</span>, <span>naturalists</span> found the <span>folk taxonomy</span> of this species and the coal tit quite confusing.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Gessner also notes that the coal tit was known as <i>Kohlmei&#xDF;</i> in <span>German</span> &#x2013; the literal equivalent of its <span>English</span> name, though in its modern <span>orthography</span> <i>Kohlmeise</i> it refers to the <span>great tit</span> (<i>Parus major</i>). That bird was in Gessner's day usually called <i>Spiegelmei&#xDF;</i> ("multicolored tit"), <i>Brandtmei&#xDF;</i> ("burnt tit") or <i>grosse Mei&#xDF;</i> ("great tit") in German. <i>K&#xF6;lmey&#xDF;</i> was attested for <i>P. major</i> by <span>William Turner</span>, but Turner does not list <i>P. ater</i> at all, while Gessner notes that his hunters always used <i>Kohlmei&#xDF;</i> for the present species. However, this has since changed, and the modern German name of <i>P. ater</i> is <i>Tannenmeise</i> ("<span>fir</span> tit"), after a typical <span>habitat</span>. This name is attested (as <i>Tannen-Maise</i>) by <span>Johann Leonhard Frisch</span> in the early 18th century already, who furthermore records that <i>P. ater</i> was also called <i>Kleine Kohl-Maise</i> ("small coal tit") whereas <i>Kohl-Maise</i> referred unequivocally to <i>P. major</i>. Frisch collected his data in the <span>Berlin</span> region, where the German dialect was <span>quite different</span> from that spoken by Gessner's <span>Alemannic</span> sources 200 years earlier, and heavily influenced by <span>Middle Low German</span> &#x2013; the language of the northern German sources of Turner. Regarding that, <i>Tanne</i> is derived from the <span>Old Saxon</span> <i>danna</i>, and thus had spread through the German <span>dialect continuum</span> from north to south.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Most authorities still treat the coal tit in the <span>subgenus</span> <i>Periparus</i>, but the <span>American Ornithologists' Union</span> considers <i>Periparus</i> a distinct <span>genus</span>. This is supported by <span>mtDNA</span> <span>cytochrome b</span> <span>sequence</span> analysis; <i>Periparus</i> seems to be closer to the <i><span>Poecile</span></i> tits and chickadees than to the great tit and its relatives. Thus, it belongs to the more advanced <span>Paridae</span>, in which the bright plumage of the more <span>basal</span> lineages is dulled down <span>apomorphically</span>.</p>

<p>In addition, the same data suggest that this species is <span>paraphyletic</span> in regard to the closely related and <span>parapatric</span> <span>spot-winged tit</span> (<i>P. melanolophus</i>) from <span>South Asia</span>, which looks like a slightly crested, darker version of <i>P. ater</i>. Consequently, the spot-winged tit might have to be included in <i>P. ater</i>, or some coal tits could be considered a distinct species. As occasional <span>hybridization</span> has been recorded between the two, mtDNA alone (which is inherited only from the mother) is insufficient to determine whether hybrid <span>gene flow</span> or another trivial cause (such as incomplete <span>lineage sorting</span>) obfuscates the actual relationships, or whether <span>taxonomic</span> rearrangement is indeed required. With the range of these titmice encircling the <span>Himalayas</span>, without further study it cannot even be excluded that they constitute a <span>ring species</span> &#x2013; with gene flow occurring in <span>Nepal</span> but not in <span>Afghanistan</span> &#x2013;, as has been shown for other <span>passerines</span> in the same region.</p>

Adult continental coal tit, <i>P. a. ater</i> (note blue-grey back)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A number of coal tit <span>subspecies</span> are distinguished. The differences in coloration are quite pronounced in some of them, while their differences in size are more subtle. Coal tits from <span>Asia</span> follow <span>Bergmann's rule</span>, being larger in colder regions; those from further west, however, do not, as the birds from the uplands around the <span>Mediterranean</span> are larger than those from northern Europe. Across its range, tail length in relation to body length increases along a <span>cline</span> running from southwest to northeast.</p>
<p>The <span>British</span> race <i>P. a. britannicus</i> has an <span>olive</span> hue to its brownish-grey back plumage, distinguishing it from the <span>continental European</span> <span>nominate subspecies</span> <i>P. a. ater</i> and <i>P. a. abietum</i> in which the back is bluish grey without a hint of green or brown. The Irish race <i>P. a. hibernicus</i> is distinguished from <i>britannicus</i> by the pale <span>sulphur</span>-yellow cheeks, breast and belly. It also has a paler rump (due to light fringes of the <span>uppertail coverts</span>) and a larger bill than its relatives from Britain and the Continent.</p>
<p>The <span>North African</span> race <i>P. a. ledouci</i> has yellow underparts and cheeks, and the <span>Cypriot</span> <i>P. a. cypriotes</i> has a buff tinge to its upperparts, and deep buff underparts. <span>Asian</span> subspecies are generally rather dusky brownish except for the black-and-white head; they include among others <i>P. a. michalowskii</i> of the <span>Caucasus</span>, <i>P. a. phaeonotus</i> of <span>Iran</span>, or the Himalayan coal tit <i>P. a. aemodius</i> of southwestern <span>China</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The coal tit is 10&#x2013;11.5&#xA0;cm in length, and has a distinctive large white nape spot on its black head. The head, throat and neck of the adult are glossy blue-black, setting off the off-white sides of the face (tinged grey to yellow depending on <span>subspecies</span>) and the brilliant white nape; the white tips of the <span>wing coverts</span> appear as two wingbars. The underparts are whitish shading through buff to rufous on the flanks. The bill is black, the legs lead-coloured, and <span>irides</span> dark brown.</p>
<p>The young birds are duller than the adults, lacking gloss on the black head, and with the white of nape and cheeks tinged with yellow.</p>
<p>While searching for food, coal tit flocks keep contact with incessant short <i>dee</i> or <i>see-see</i> calls. The species' song &#x2013; if "song" it can be called &#x2013; is a strident <i>if-he, if-he, if-he</i>, heard most frequently from January to June, but also in autumn. One variant of this song ends with a sharp <i>ichi</i>. North African birds also have a <i>currr</i> call similar to that of the <span>European crested tit</span> (<i>Lophophanes cristatus</i>) which is not found in Africa.</p>

</div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour_and_ecology">Behaviour and ecology</span></h2>
<p>It is typically a bird of <span>temperate</span> <span>humid</span> <span>conifer</span> <span>forest</span>, but apart from that shows little <span>habitat</span> specificity. In <span>Bhutan</span> for example coal tits are fairly common residents above the <span>subtropical</span> zone, at about 3,000-3,800 m <span>ASL</span>, and are found in forests dominated by <span>Bhutan Fir</span> (<i>Abies densa</i>) as well as in those characterized by <span>Himalayan Hemlock</span> (<i>Tsuga dumosa</i>) and <span>rhododendrons</span>.</p>
<p>The coal tit is an all-year resident throughout almost all range, making only local movements in response to particularly severe weather; only the <span>Siberian</span> birds have a more regular <span>migration</span>. Very rarely, vagrants may cross longer distances; for example the <span>nominate subspecies</span> of <span>continental Europe</span> was recorded in <span>Ireland</span> once in 1960 and once before that, but apparently not since then.</p>
<p>Coal tits will form small flocks in winter with other tits. This species resembles other tits in acrobatic skill and restless activity, though it more frequently pitches on a trunk, and in little hops resembles a <span>treecreeper</span> (<i>Certhia</i>). Its food is similar to that of the others; it is keen on <span>beechmast</span>, picks out the seeds from <span>fir</span> (<i>Abies</i>) and <span>larch</span> (<i>Larix</i>) cones, and joins <i><span>Carduelis</span></i> <span>redpolls</span> and <span>siskins</span> in <span>alders</span> (<i>Alnus</i>) and <span>birches</span> (<i>Betula</i>). It will also visit <span>gardens</span> to feed on a variety of foods put out, particularly <span>sunflower seeds</span>.</p>
<p>A favourite nesting site is a hole in a rotting tree-stump, often low down, and the nest is deep within the hole; holes in the ground, burrows of <span>mice</span> or <span>rabbits</span>, chinks between the stones in walls, old nests of <i><span>Pica</span></i> magpies or other large birds, and <span>squirrel</span> dreys are also occupied. The materials, moss, hair and grass, are closely felted together, and rabbit fur or feathers added for lining. Seven to eleven red-spotted white <span>eggs</span> of the usual tit type are laid, usually in May; this species breeds usually once per year.</p>
<p>Being common and widespread, the coal tit is not considered a <span>threatened species</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
