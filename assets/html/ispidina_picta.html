<p>The <b>African pygmy kingfisher</b> (<i>Ispidina picta</i>) is a small <span>insectivorous</span> <span>kingfisher</span> found in the <span>Afrotropics</span>, mostly in <span>woodland</span> habitats. Some texts refer to this species as <i>Ceyx pictus</i>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The African pygmy kingfisher is approximately 12&#x2013;13&#xA0;cm in length. A very small kingfisher with rufous underparts and a blue back extending down to the tail. The dark blue crown of the adult separates it from the <span>African dwarf kingfisher</span>. The smaller size and violet wash on the ear coverts distinguish it from the similar malachite kingfisher.</p>
<p>The <i>natalensis</i> subspecies occurring in the south of the range has paler underparts and a blue spot above the white ear patch. Juveniles have less extensive violet on their ear coverts and a black rather than orange bill. Usually found singly or in pairs. Secretive and unobtrusive. The call is a high-pitched insect-like "tsip-tsip" given in flight. The African pygmy kingfisher is found in woodland, <span>savanna</span> and coastal <span>forest</span>. Being insectivorous, it is not bound to water.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_distribution">Status and distribution</span></h2>
<p>The African pygmy kingfisher is distributed widely in <span>Africa south of the Sahara</span>, where it is a common resident and intra-African <span>migrant</span>. It is absent from much of the <span>horn of Africa</span>, and also the drier western regions of <span>Southern Africa</span>.</p>
