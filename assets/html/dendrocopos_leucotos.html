<p>The <b>white-backed woodpecker</b> (<i>Dendrocopos leucotos</i>) is a <span>Eurasian</span> <span>woodpecker</span> belonging to the genus <i>Dendrocopos</i>.</p>
<p>It is the largest of the spotted woodpeckers in the <span>western Palearctic</span>, 24&#x2013;26&#xA0;cm long with wing-span 38&#x2013;40&#xA0;cm and has <span>plumage</span> similar to the <span>great spotted woodpecker</span>, but with white bars across the wings rather than spots, and a white lower back. The male has a red crown, the female a black one.</p>
<p>The nominate race <i>D. l. leucotos</i> occurs in central and northern <span>Europe</span>, with the race <i>D. l. lilfordi</i> found in the <span>Balkans</span> and <span>Turkey</span>. Ten further races occur in the region eastwards as far as <span>Korea</span> and <span>Japan</span>. It is a scarce bird, requiring large, mature woods with plenty of dead wood. Numbers have decreased in <span>Nordic countries</span>. In <span>Sweden</span>, its population decline has caused the Swedish government to enact protection for the species in the national <span>Biodiversity Action Plan</span>.</p>
<p>In the breeding season it excavates a nest hole about 7&#xA0;cm wide and 30&#xA0;cm deep in a decaying tree trunk. It lays three to five white <span>eggs</span> and incubates for 10&#x2013;11 days. It lives predominantly on wood-boring beetles as well as their <span>larvae</span>, as well as other <span>insects</span>, nuts, seeds and berries. Drumming by males is very loud, calls include a soft <i>kiuk</i> and a longer <i>kweek</i>.</p>
