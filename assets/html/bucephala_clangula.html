<p>The <b>common goldeneye</b> (<i>Bucephala clangula</i>) is a medium-sized <span>sea duck</span> of the genus <i>Bucephala</i>, the <span>goldeneyes</span>. Their closest relative is the similar <span>Barrow's goldeneye</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Adult males ranges from 45&#x2013;52&#xA0;cm (18&#x2013;20&#xA0;in) and from 888 to 1,400&#xA0;g (1.958 to 3.086&#xA0;lb), while females range from 40&#x2013;50&#xA0;cm (16&#x2013;20&#xA0;in) and from 500 to 1,182&#xA0;g (1.102 to 2.606&#xA0;lb). The species is named for its golden-yellow eye. Adult males have a dark head with a greenish gloss and a circular white patch below the eye, a dark back and a white neck and belly. Adult females have a brown head and a mostly grey body. Their legs and feet are orange-yellow.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_Breeding">Habitat and Breeding</span></h2>
<p>Their breeding habitat is the <span>taiga</span>. They are found in the lakes and rivers of boreal forests across <span>Canada</span> and the northern <span>United States</span>, <span>Scandinavia</span> and northern <span>Russia</span>. They are <span>migratory</span> and most winter in protected coastal waters or open inland waters at more temperate latitudes. Naturally, they nest in cavities in large trees. They will readily use nestboxes, and this has enabled a healthy breeding population to establish in <span>Scotland</span> where they are increasing and slowly spreading with the help of nestboxes. They are usually quite common in winter around lakes of <span>Britain</span> and some are being encouraged to nest in nestboxes which are put up to try to have them there all year round. Occasionally recorded as a vagrant in various parts of the <span>Indian Subcontinent</span>.</p>
<p>Often the natural tree cavities are made by broken limbs, unless they are made by <span>pileated woodpeckers</span> or <span>black woodpeckers</span>, the only tree-cavity-making animals who make a cavity large enough to normally accommodate a goldeneye. Average egg size is a breadth of 43.3&#xA0;mm (1.70&#xA0;in), a length of 59.3&#xA0;mm (2.33&#xA0;in) and a weight of 64&#xA0;g (2.3&#xA0;oz). The incubation period ranges from 28 to 32 days. The female does all the incubating and is abandoned by the male about 1 to 2 weeks into incubation. The young remain in the nest for about 24&#x2013;36 hours. <span>Brood parasitism</span> is quite common both with other common goldeneyes as well as with other duck species, and even <span>tree swallow</span> and <span>European starling</span> eggs have been found mixed with goldeneye eggs. The broods commonly start to mix with other females' broods as they become more independent. Goldeneye young have been known to be competitively killed by other goldeneye mothers, <span>common loons</span> and <span>red-necked grebes</span>. The young are capable of flight at 55&#x2013;65 days of age.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>These diving birds forage underwater. Year-round, about 32% of their prey is <span>crustaceans</span>, 28% is aquatic <span>insects</span> and 10% is <span>molluscs</span>. <span>Insects</span> are the predominant prey while nesting and <span>crustaceans</span> are the predominant prey during migration and winter. Locally, <span>fish</span> eggs and aquatic <span>plants</span> can be important foods. They themselves may fall prey to various <span>hawks</span>, <span>owls</span> and <span>eagles</span>, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by <span>bears</span> (<i>Ursus</i> spp.), various <span>weasels</span> (<i>Mustela</i> spp.), <span>mink</span> (<i>Mustela vison</i>), <span>raccoons</span> (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) and even <span>Northern Flickers</span> (<i>Colaptes auratus</i>) and <span>red squirrels</span> (<i>Tamiasciurus husonicus</i>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The common goldeneye is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. Approximately 188,300 common goldeneyes were killed by <span>duck hunters</span> in <span>North America</span> during the 1970s, representing about 4% of the total number of ducks killed in the region during that period. The rate is probably similar today. Both the breeding and winter habitat of these birds has been degraded by clearance and pollution. However, this is the only duck in North America known to derive short-term benefits from lake acidification.</p>
