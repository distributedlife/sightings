<p>The <b>Spotted Crake</b> (<i>Porzana porzana</i>) is a small waterbird, of the family <span>Rallidae</span>.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is <span>marshes</span> and <span>sedge</span> beds across temperate <span>Europe</span> into western <span>Asia</span>. They nest in a dry location in marsh vegetation, laying 6-15 <span>eggs</span>. This species is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in <span>Africa</span> and <span>Pakistan</span>.</p>
<p>At 19-22.5&#xA0;cm length, Spotted Crakes are slightly smaller than <span>Water Rails</span>, from which they are readily distinguished by the short straight bill, yellow with a red base. Adults have mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey breast, with dark barring and white spots on the flanks. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is buff underneath.</p>
<p>Immature Spotted Crakes are similar, but the blue-grey is replaced by brown. The downy chicks are black, as with all <span>rails</span>.</p>
<p>The only confusion species is the <span>Sora</span>, a rare vagrant from <span>North America</span>. However, that species lacks the breast spotting and has an unstreaked crown stripe.</p>
<p>These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat <span>insects</span> and aquatic animals.</p>
<p>Spotted Crakes are very secretive in the breeding season, and are then mostly heard rather than seen. They are then noisy <span>birds</span>, with a distinctive repetitive whiplash-like <i>hwuit, hwuit</i> call. They can be easier to see on migration.</p>
<p>The Spotted is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
