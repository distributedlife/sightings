<p>The <b>Cape petrel</b> (<i>Daption capense</i>) also called <b>Cape pigeon</b> or <b>pintado petrel</b>, is a common <span>seabird</span> of the <span>Southern Ocean</span> from the <span>family</span> <span>Procellariidae</span>. It is the <span>only member</span> of the <span>genus</span> <i>Daption</i>, and is allied to the <span>fulmarine petrels</span>, and the <span>giant petrels</span>. It is also sometimes known as the <b>Cape fulmar</b>. They are extremely common seabirds with an estimated population of around 2 million.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The Cape petrel is the only known member of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Daption</span></i> and is in turn a member of the <span>family</span> <span>Procellariidae</span> and <span>order</span> <span>Procellariiformes</span>. There appears to be a subgroup within the family consisting of the <span>giant petrels</span>, the members of <i><span>Fulmarus</span></i>, the <span>Antarctic petrel</span>, and the <span>snow petrel</span>.</p>
<p>All Procellariiformes share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the <span>bill</span>. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>The Cape petrel has two <span>subspecies</span></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Cape petrel is a unique looking petrel. It has a black head and neck, and a white belly, breast, and its underwing is white with a black border. Its back, and upperwings are black and white speckled, as is its tail which also has a band of black. When fully grown, their wings span 86&#xA0;cm (34&#xA0;in) and they are 39&#xA0;cm (15&#xA0;in) long.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Daption</i> is derived from <span>Ancient Greek</span> for "little devourer", and the <i>Cape</i> name is because of where the <span>type</span> specimen was collected. Finally, <i>pintado</i> is <span>Spanish</span> for "painted" for its plumage. One of their other names, Cape pigeon, is from their habit of pecking at the water for food. The word <i>petrel</i> is derived from <span>St. Peter</span> and the story of his walking on water. This is in reference to the petrel's habit of appearing to run on the water to take off.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>The Cape petrels' diet is 80% <span>crustaceans</span>, as well as <span>fish</span> and <span>squid</span>. <span>Krill</span> is their favourite crustacean, which they obtain by surface seizing as well as diving under water and filtering them out. They are also known for following ships and eating edible waste and carcasses thrown overboard. They are aggressive while feeding and will spit their stomach oil at competitors, even their own species.</p>

<p>They are <span>colonial</span> birds, and nest on cliffs or level ground within a kilometre of the ocean. They tend to have smaller colonies than other petrels. Their nests are formed with pebbles and are placed under overhanging rock for protection, or in a crevice. In November they lay a single <span>egg</span>, which is <span>incubated</span> for 45 days by both sexes. Like most other <span>fulmars</span>, they will defend their nest by spitting <span>stomach oil</span>. <span>Skuas</span> in particular will prey on Cape petrel eggs and chicks. Upon hatching, the chick is <span>brooded</span> for ten days until it can <span>thermoregulate</span>, after which both parents assist in the feeding. The chicks <span>fledge</span> after 45 more days, around March.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>During breeding season, Cape petrels feed around <span>Antarctica</span>'s shelf and during the winter they range further north, as far as <span>Angola</span> and the <span>Galapagos Islands</span>. They breed on many islands of <span>Antarctica</span> and the <span>subantarctic islands</span>, some going as far as the <span>Auckland Islands</span>, the <span>Chatham Islands</span>, <span>Campbell Island</span>. Their main breeding grounds were on the <span>Antarctic Peninsula</span>, <span>South Georgia</span>, the <span>Balleny Islands</span>, the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>, as well as islands in the <span>Scotia Sea</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The Cape petrel has an occurrence range of 146,000,000&#xA0;km (56,370,915&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) and a 2009 estimate places their population of adult birds at 2 million. Consequently, the <span>IUCN</span> rates them as <span>least concern</span>.</p>
