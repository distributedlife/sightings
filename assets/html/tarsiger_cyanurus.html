<p>The <b>red-flanked bluetail</b> (<i>Tarsiger cyanurus</i>), also known as the <b>orange-flanked bush-robin</b>, is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> that was formerly classed as a member of the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an <span>Old World flycatcher</span>, Muscicapidae. It, and related species, are often called <span>chats</span>.</p>
<p>It is a <span>migratory</span> insectivorous species breeding in mixed <span>coniferous</span> forest with undergrowth in northern <span>Asia</span> and northeastern <span>Europe</span>, from <span>Finland</span> east across <span>Siberia</span> to <span>Kamchatka</span> and south to <span>Japan</span>. It winters mainly in southeastern Asia, in the <span>Indian Subcontinent</span>, the <span>Himalayas</span>, <span>Taiwan</span>, and northern <span>Indochina</span>. The breeding range is slowly expanding westwards through Finland (where up to 500 pairs now breeding), and it is a rare but increasing <span>vagrant</span> to western Europe, mainly to <span>Great Britain</span>. There have also been a few records in westernmost <span>North America</span>, mostly in western <span>Alaska</span>.</p>
<p>At 13&#x2013;14&#xA0;cm long and 10&#x2013;18 g weight, the red-flanked bluetail is similar in size and weight to the <span>common redstart</span> and slightly smaller (particularly with a slimmer build) than the <span>European robin</span>. As the name implies, both sexes have a blue tail and rump, and orange-red flanks; they also have a white throat and greyish-white underparts, and a small, thin black bill and slender black legs. The adult male additionally has dark blue upperparts, while females and immature males are plain brown above apart from the blue rump and tail, and have a dusky breast. In behaviour, it is similar to a common redstart, frequently flicking its tail in the same manner, and regularly flying from a perch to catch insects in the air or on the ground. The male sings its melancholy trill from treetops. Its call is a typical chat "tacc" noise. The nest is built on or near the ground, with 3&#x2013;5 eggs which are incubated by the female.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy_and_nomenclature">Taxonomy and nomenclature</span></h2>
<p>In the past generally treated as comprising two <span>subspecies</span>, <i>T. c. cyanurus</i> breeding in northern Asia and <i>T. c. rufilatus</i> breeding in the <span>Himalaya</span>, it is now increasingly being treated as monotypic, with <i>T. c. rufilatus</i> split off as a distinct species, <span>Himalayan bluetail</span> <i>T. rufilatus</i>. The species has also been known by a variety of English and scientific names in the ornithological literature.
