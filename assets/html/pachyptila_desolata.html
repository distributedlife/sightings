<p>The <b>Antarctic prion</b> (<i>Pachyptila desolata</i>) also known as the <b>dove prion</b>, or <b>totorore</b> in <span>Maori</span>, is the largest of the <span>prions</span>, a <span>genus</span> of small <span>petrels</span> of the <span>Southern Ocean</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The Antarctic prion is a member of the <span>Pachyptila</span> <span>genus</span>, and along with the <span>blue petrel</span> makes up the <span>prions</span>. They in turn are members of the <span>Procellariidae</span> <span>family</span>, and the <span>Procellariiformes</span> <span>order</span>. The prions are small and typically eat just <span>zooplankton</span>; however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a <span>stomach oil</span> made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>The Antarctic prion has three subspecies.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Pachyptila</i>, the word, comes from the <span>Greek</span> words <i>pakhus</i> and <i>ptilon</i>. <i>Pakhus</i> means "thick" or "stout" and <i>ptilon</i> means "a feather". <i>Desolatus</i> is <span>Latin</span> for "forsaken" or "desolate". This is in reference to the desolate Antarctic region where they live. Also from the Greek language, <i>prion</i> comes from the word <i>pri&#x14D;n</i> meaning "a saw", in reference to the serrated edges of its <span>bill</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The <span>wingspan</span> is 17 to 20&#xA0;cm (6.7 to 7.9&#xA0;in), while the body length is 28&#xA0;cm (11&#xA0;in). Like all <span>prions</span>, its underparts are white and upperparts are blue-grey, with a dark "M" across its back to its wingtips. It has a white eyebrow, blue-grey <span>bill</span>, and blue feet. It also has a grey wedge-shaped tail with a black tip. On its wings, its greater <span>coverts</span> are near black.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Like all prions, the Antarctic prion eats primarily <span>zooplankton</span>, which it obtains by filtering water through its upper bill.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The Antarctic prion nests in <span>colonies</span>, and prefers islands in the <span>Southern ocean</span>. Both sexes assist in building the nest, as well as <span>incubating</span> the single <span>egg</span> and raising the chick.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It breeds in colonies on the <span>Auckland Islands</span>, <span>Heard Island</span>, <span>Macquarie Island</span>, <span>Scott Island</span>, <span>South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</span>, the <span>South Orkney Islands</span>, <span>South Shetland Islands</span>, <span>Crozet Islands</span>, and the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>. When not breeding, it ranges throughout the southern oceans.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The Antarctic prion has an occurrence range of 76,600,000&#xA0;km (29,600,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) and an estimated adult bird population of 50 million.</p>
