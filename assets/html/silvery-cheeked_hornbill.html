<p>The <b>silvery-cheeked hornbill</b> (<i>Bycanistes brevis</i>) is a large bird at 75 to 80 centimetres (30 to 31&#xA0;in) in length, with a very large cream-colored <span>casque</span> on the beak. The female has a smaller casque and reddish skin around the eyes. The head is silver-grey and the rest of the <span>plumage</span> is iridescent black, except for the white rump, lower back, thighs, vent and tip of the outer tail-feathers. Silvery-cheeked hornbills are residents of the tall evergreen forests of <span>East Africa</span> from <span>Ethiopia</span> to <span>South Africa</span>. In <span>Zimbabwe</span> it is threatened by <span>habitat destruction</span> and its presence in South Africa is marginal, but it remains locally fairly common, especially in the northern and central parts of its range. Usually they live in pairs and sometimes roost in flocks of hundreds of individuals. This hornbill feeds on fruits, insects, small birds, rodents, small reptiles and <span>centipedes</span>. They breed in spring (September and October; at least in part of its range) and lay clutches of one to three white eggs, incubated for 40 days. The young remain with both parents for about 80 days.</p>
