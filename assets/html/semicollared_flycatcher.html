<p>The <b>semicollared flycatcher</b> (<i>Ficedula semitorquata</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> bird in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family, one of the four species of <span>Western Palearctic black-and-white flycatchers</span>. It breeds in the southeastern corner of <span>Europe</span>, the <span>Middle East</span> and southwestern <span>Asia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in <span>Africa</span>. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe.</p>
<p>This is a 12-13.5&#xA0;cm long bird, intermediate in appearance between <span>collared flycatcher</span> and <span>European pied flycatcher</span>. It has often been classed as a subspecies of collared flycatcher.</p>
<p>The breeding male is mainly black above and white below, with a white half-collar, extending further back than in pied, large white wing patch, extensively white tail sides and a large white forehead patch. It has a pale grey rump. The bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. It mainly takes insects in flight, rarely hunting <span>caterpillars</span> amongst the tree foliage like pied flycatcher.</p>
<p>Non-breeding male, females and juvenile semi-collared flycatchers have the black replaced by a pale brown, and may be very difficult to distinguish from other <i>Fidecula</i> flycatchers, particularly the collared flycatcher. A distinction is that semi-collared may show a white second wing bar, but many individuals are not separable in the field.</p>
<p>Semicollared flycatchers are birds of belts of deciduous woodlands, especially <span>oak</span> and <span>hornbeam</span>, in mountainous areas. They build an open nest in a tree hole, and 4-7 eggs are laid. The song is again intermediate between collared and pied flycatchers, with slow strained whistles, but some rhythmic elements.</p>
