<p>The <b>Gambian pouched rat</b> (<i>Cricetomys gambianus</i>), also known as the <b>African giant pouched rat</b>, is a <span>nocturnal</span> <span>pouched rat</span> of the <span>giant pouched rat</span> <span>genus</span> <i>Cricetomys</i>. It is among the largest <span>muroids</span> in the world, growing up to about 0.9 metres (3&#xA0;ft) long including their tail which makes up half their length. It is widespread in <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>, ranging geographically from <span>Senegal</span> to <span>Kenya</span> and from <span>Angola</span> to <span>Mozambique</span> (although it is absent from much of the <span>DR Congo</span>, where <span>Emin's pouched rat</span> is present) and in altitude from <span>sea level</span> to 2,000 metres (6,600&#xA0;ft).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The Gambian pouched rat has very poor <span>eyesight</span> and so depends on its senses of <span>smell</span> and <span>hearing</span>. Its name comes from the large, <span>hamster</span>-like pouches in its cheeks. It is not a true <span>rat</span> but is part of a uniquely African branch of <span>muroid rodents</span>. It typically weighs between 1 and 1.4 kilograms (2.2 and 3.1&#xA0;lb). In its native Africa, this pouched rat lives in colonies of up to twenty, usually in forests and thickets, but also commonly in <span>termite</span> mounds. It is <span>omnivorous</span>, feeding on <span>vegetables</span>, <span>insects</span>, <span>crabs</span>, <span>snails</span>, and other items, but apparently preferring <span>palm</span> <span>fruits</span> and palm kernels.</p>
<p>Unlike <span>domestic rats</span>, it has cheek pouches like a hamster. These cheek pouches allow it to gather up several kilograms of nuts per night for storage underground. It has been known to stuff its pouches so full of <span>date palm</span> nuts so as to be hardly able to squeeze through the entrance of its burrow. The burrow consists of a long passage with side alleys and several chambers, one for sleeping and the others for storage. The Gambian pouched rat reaches <span>sexual maturity</span> at 5&#x2013;7 months of age. It has up to four litters every nine months, with up to six offspring in each litter. Males are territorial and tend to be aggressive when they encounter one another.</p>

</div>
<p>Gambian pouched rats have become an <span>invasive species</span> on <span>Grassy Key</span> in the <span>Florida Keys</span>, after a private breeder allowed the animals to escape. This outsized African rodent is also believed to be responsible for the current outbreak of <span>monkeypox</span> in the <span>United States</span>, after spreading it to <span>prairie dogs</span> which were purchased as pets. In 2003, the United States' <span>CDC</span> and <span>FDA</span> issued an order preventing the importation of the rodents following the first reported outbreak of monkeypox. Around 20 individuals were affected.</p>

<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>APOPO</span></div>
<p>A <span>Tanzanian</span> social enterprise founded by two Belgians called <span>APOPO</span>, trains Gambian pouched rats to detect <span>land mines</span> and <span>tuberculosis</span> with their highly developed sense of smell. The trained pouched rats are called <span>HeroRATS</span>.</p>
<p>Currently studies are being conducted in the USA and other locations about the best ways to train these creatures and their abilities/limits to detecting the mines</p>
