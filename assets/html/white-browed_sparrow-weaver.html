<p>The <b>White-browed Sparrow-Weaver</b> (<i>Plocepasser mahali</i>) is a predominantly brown, <span>sparrow</span>-sized bird found throughout central and northcentral southern <span>Africa</span>. It is found in groups of two to eleven individuals consisting of one breeding pair and nonreproductive individuals.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>There are four recognized <span>subspecies</span> of the White-browed Sparrow-Weaver.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It ranges from 17 to 19&#xA0;cm (6.7 to 7.5&#xA0;in) in length and is characterized by a broad, white eyebrow stripe and white rump visible in flight. While the male White-browed Sparrow-Weaver sports a black bill, the female's bill is horn-colored; that of the juvenile is pinkish-brown. In Zimbabwe, the White-browed Sparrow-Weaver shows faint brown spotting across its white breast.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h3>
<p>The White-browed Sparrow-Weaver may emit either a brief <i>chik-chick</i> or a loud, fluid, <i>cheoop-preeoo-chop</i> whistle.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Similar_species">Similar species</span></h3>
<p>The <span>Yellow-throated Petronia</span> has a pinkish brown (not black) bill, a buff (not white) eyebrow stripe, black (not pink) feet, and yellow shading at the bottom of a white throat. Additionally, the White-browed Sparrow-Weaver is larger than the Yellow-throated Petronia. Unlike the White-browed Sparrow-Weaver, the Yellow-throated Petronia may be found in broad-leaved woodland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution.2C_habitat_and_migration">Distribution, habitat and migration</span></h2>
<p>The White-browed Sparrow-Weaver is found in greatest numbers in north-central southern Africa. While this species most densely populates at dry regions with woodland or wooded grassland at northern <span>South Africa</span>, its range includes <span>Botswana</span>, northern and central <span>Namibia</span>, and western <span>Zimbabwe</span>. It is seen very often in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia and southern Malawi. Populations may be found as far north as <span>Ethiopia</span>.</p>
<p>This species nests along <span>thornveld</span> and scrubby, dry riverbanks.</p>
<p>Because the White-browed Sparrow-Weaver nests in colonies, populations are sedentary.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nesting">Nesting</span></h3>
<p>Year round, groups of the White-browed Sparrow-Weaver are active and nest-building. Groups of ten to sixty inverted-U-shaped nests of dry grass appear in the outside limbs of trees, although only several are used for breeding or roosting. While breeding nests have only one entrance, roosting nests have an entrance located at each of the two nest extremities. Research has shown that, throughout a region, nests are located at the leeward side of a tree. This behavior preserves a greater number of intact nests for breeding and roosting. White-browed Sparrow-Weaver nests are sometimes used by other birds, such as the <span>Red-headed Finch</span> and <span>Ashy Tit</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Breeding has been observed year round, but occurs mainly in warmer months.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>The White-browed Sparrow-Weaver is becoming more abundant, expanding its range on southern, northern, and eastern fronts.</p>
