<p>The <b>Locust Finch</b> (<i>Paludipasser locustella</i>) is a species of <span>estrildid finch</span> found in south-east <span>Cameroon</span>, the <span>Republic of Congo</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Angola</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Malawi</span> (central region), <span>Mozambique</span> (rare), <span>Zimbabwe</span> (rare) and <span>Botswana</span>. It is sometimes placed in the genus <i><b>Ortygospiza</b></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threats">Threats</span></h2>
<p>The Locust Finch was previously listed as <span>Near Threatened</span>. However, due to lack of information, it was suggested that it remains widespread and locally common, and there is no evidence of significant declines. The population of this species may have declined for the past few decades due to a series of droughts in the 1980s. It is threatened by the cage-bird trade and loss of marshland habitat, partly due to dry periods.</p>
