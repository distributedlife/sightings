<p>The <b>ground woodpecker</b> (<i>Geocolaptes olivaceus</i>) is one of only three ground-dwelling woodpeckers in the world (the others are the <span>Andean</span> and <span>Campo flickers</span>). It inhabits rather barren, steep, boulder-strewn slopes in relatively cool hilly and mountainous areas of <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Lesotho</span> and <span>Swaziland</span> and has yet to be recorded outside of <span>Southern Africa</span>. It is the largest woodpecker in the region, reaching 30&#xA0;cm in length. It usually goes about in pairs or small parties and is best located by its loud, raucous 2-note call (<i>chik-ree</i>, <i>chik-ree</i>) with head-swinging. It often peers over or around rocks at intruders. It breeds in spring and early summer (August to November), and the nest is in a tunnel excavated by the bird itself in the vertical bank of a stream or watercourse.</p>

<p>It is to be found in a broad swath running from south-west to north-east, from the <span>Cape Peninsula</span> and <span>Namaqualand</span> to <span>Mpumalanga</span>. Its diet consists mainly of ants with their larvae, pupae and eggs. These are extracted from dead wood or between rocks, using its long, sticky tongue. Usually 3 glossy white eggs are laid in a chamber at the end of the tunnel.</p>
