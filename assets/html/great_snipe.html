<p>The <b>great snipe</b> (<i>Gallinago media</i>) is a small stocky <span>wader</span> in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Gallinago</span></i>.</p>
<p>This bird's breeding habitat is marshes and wet meadows with short vegetation in north-eastern <span>Europe</span> including north-western <span>Russia</span>. Great snipes are <span>migratory</span>, wintering in <span>Africa</span>. The European breeding population is in steep decline.</p>
<p>The birds are noted for their fast, non-stop flying capabilities over huge distances. They can fly up to 97 kilometres per hour, with researchers finding little evidence of wind assistance. Some have been recorded to fly non-stop for 48 hours over 6,760 kilometres (4,200&#xA0;mi). Their wings are not especially aerodynamic, lacking pointed tips, and they typically do not stop to feed despite having opportunities. The birds instead rely on stores of fat.</p>
<p>Voice &#x2013; a faint <i>yeah</i>. Mating display calls of groups can be heard at long distances (more than 300 m) include rising and falling series of chirping calls and accelerating clicking noises.</p>
<p>The males display at a dusk <span>lek</span> during the breeding season, standing erect with chest puffed and tail fanned. They may jump into the air. They produce a variety of rattles, clicks, buzzes and whistles while displaying. 3-4 eggs are laid in a nest in a well-hidden location on the ground.</p>
<p>These birds forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat <span>insects</span> and <span>earthworms</span>, and occasional plant material. They are difficult to see, being well camouflaged in their habitat. When flushed from cover, they fly straight for a considerable distance before dropping back into vegetation.</p>
<p>At 26&#x2013;30&#xA0;cm in length and a 42&#x2013;50&#xA0;cm wingspan, adults are only slightly larger, but much bulkier, than <span>common snipe</span> and have a shorter bill. The body is mottled brown on top and barred underneath. They have a dark stripe through the eye. The wings are broad, and a pale wingbar is visible in flight.</p>
<p>The great snipe is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fossils">Fossils</span></h2>
<p>Fossils of the great snipe have been uncovered in <span>North Carolina</span>, dating back to about 4.465 Ma &#xB1;0.865M. This suggests the bird must have at some point relocated across the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span>.</p>
