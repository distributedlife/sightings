<p>The <b>Cinderella Waxbill</b> (<i>Estrilda thomensis</i>) is a near-threatened species of <span>estrildid finch</span> found in drier regions of south-western <span>Angola</span> around <span>Namibe Province</span>, north and east to south-west <span>Huila Province</span> and north to <span>Fazenda do Cuito</span> in <span>Huambo</span> and extreme north-western <span>Namibia</span>. It has an estimated global distribution of 95,700&#xA0;km&#xB2;.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Cinderella Waxbill is found in subtropical and tropical (lowland) dry shrubland, savanna and forest habitats at altitude of 200 to 500&#xA0;m. It is observed that the recent development of a <span>hydroelectric plant</span> on the <span>Cunene River</span> at <span>Epupa Falls</span> has caused changes to insect biodiversity which were relied on by the Cinderella Waxbill during feeding of its young. Thus threatening its food source to be depleted. The Waxbill also eats a regular diet. It eats plants-grass seeds and nectar- as well as insects-scale insects and termite alates. The Cinderella is diurnal, which means that they are awake in the daytime and sleep at night.</p>
