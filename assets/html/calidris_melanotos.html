<p>The <b>pectoral sandpiper</b> (<i>Calidris melanotos</i>) is a small, <span>migratory</span> <span>wader</span> that breeds in <span>North America</span> and <span>Asia</span>, <span>wintering</span> in <span>South America</span> and <span>Oceania</span>. It eats small <span>invertebrates</span>. Its <span>nest</span>, a hole scraped in the ground and with a thick lining, is deep enough to protect its four <span>eggs</span> from the cool breezes of its breeding grounds. The pectoral sandpiper is 21&#xA0;cm (8.3&#xA0;in) long, with a wingspan of 46&#xA0;cm (18&#xA0;in).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The pectoral sandpiper is sometimes separated with the "<span>stint</span>" sandpipers in <i>Erolia</i>. This may or may not represent a good <span>monophyletic</span> group, depending on the placement of the <span>phylogenetically</span> enigmatic <span>curlew sandpiper</span> (<i>"C." ferruginea</i>), the <span>type species</span> of <i>Erolia</i>. In any case, the genus name <i>Ereunetes</i>&#x2014;formerly used for the <span>western sandpiper</span> (<i>"C." mauri</i>) and <span>semipalmated sandpiper</span> (<i>"C." pusilla</i>), which are also members of the stint <span>clade</span>&#x2014;was established before <i>Erolia</i>.</p>
<p>"<span>Cox's sandpiper</span>" (<i>"Calidris"</i> &#xD7; <i>paramelanotos</i>) is a stereotyped <span>hybrid</span> between this species and the curlew sandpiper. This does not prove a particularly close relationship between these two species, as far more distantly related waders <span>have successfully hybridized</span>. In any case, among the stint clade the <span>red-necked stint</span> (<i>"C." ruficollis</i>) and the <span>long-toed stint</span> (<i>"C." subminuta</i>) are particularly close relatives of the pectoral sandpiper.</p>

<p>This bird looks similar to the widely <span>sympatric</span> <span>sharp-tailed sandpiper</span> (<i>"C." acuminata</i>), which is not a member of the stint clade however. The pectoral sandpiper is a largish <span>calidrid</span> (21&#xA0;cm (8.3&#xA0;in) in length, with a wingspan of 46&#xA0;cm (18&#xA0;in)) with a grey-brown back, brownest in the summer male, and greyest in winter. The pectoral sandpiper has a grey breast, sharply demarcated at its lower edge, which gives this species its <span>English</span> name; this clear dividing line is particularly conspicuous if the birds are turned towards the observer. The legs are yellowish, and the bill is olive with a darker tip.</p>
<p>The juveniles are more brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes.</p>
<p>This species differs from the sharp-tailed sandpiper in its breast pattern, weaker <span>supercilium</span> and greyer crown.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_ecology">Distribution and ecology</span></h2>
<p>It is a very long-distance <span>migrant</span>, and about half of the species breeds in the boggy <span>tundra</span> of northeast <span>Asia</span>, the rest nesting in a range from <span>Alaska</span> to central <span>Canada</span>. The American and most of the Asian birds winter in <span>South America</span>, but some Asian breeders winter in southern and <span>Australia</span> and <span>New Zealand</span>. On migration and in winter, the Pectoral Sandpiper is typically found in <span>freshwater</span> <span>habitats</span>.</p>
<p>This species also occurs as a regular migrant to western <span>Europe</span>, and is seen most years in <span>Ireland</span> or <span>Great Britain</span>. While the pectoral sandpiper has not been recorded as breeding species in Europe, vagrant individuals were found in <span>Scotland</span> in suitable breeding habitat during summer. Many of the birds occurring in Western Europe may be on a regular migration from Asian breeding grounds to winter in Southern Africa. September 2003 saw a record influx to those two countries, with 40 found in Ireland and 150 in Great Britain. On the US Pacific coast, such stagings of migrant flocks appear to be rarer. Vagrant individuals are sometimes seen elsewhere off the usual migration routes, e.g. on the <span>Marianas</span>, the <span>Marshall Islands</span> and <span>Palau</span> in <span>Micronesia</span>; they are somewhat more frequently encountered on the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span>.</p>
<p>The pectoral sandpiper's migration might be affected by <span>global warming</span>, as is suspected for many Arctic-breeding birds: 100 years ago, migrating pectoral sandpipers were observed to pass through northern <span>Ohio</span> in early-mid May and again in late August; today, the bulk of the northward migration takes place in April already, and most birds do not return until mid-September.</p>
<p>These birds forage on grasslands and mudflats, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat <span>arthropods</span> and other <span>invertebrates</span>. The male has a courtship display which involves puffing up his breast, which has a fat sac in the breeding season to enhance his performance.</p>
<p>The pectoral sandpiper builds a steep-sided <span>scrape nest</span> with a considerable volume of lining material. The nest is deep enough that the <span>eggs</span> sit about 3&#xA0;cm (1.2&#xA0;in) below ground level, which helps to minimize heat loss from the cool breezes which occur at the latitudes where the species nests. The female lays four eggs.</p>
