<p>The <b>slaty-backed gull</b> (<i>Larus schistisagus</i>) is a large white-headed <span>gull</span> that breeds on the western coast of <span>Alaska</span> but travels widely during nonbreeding seasons. It is similar in appearance to the <span>western gull</span> and the <span>glaucous-winged gull</span>. Another alternate name is <b>Pacific gull</b>, though this also applies to a southern hemisphere species, <i><span>Larus pacificus</span></i>. Claims have been made as to its (sometimes occasional) presence throughout North America as well as the eastern coast of Asia. On November 3, 2012, an individual was spotted in <span>Finland</span>. The species has only been spotted three times before in <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>The slaty-backed gull is the fourth largest species of gull in the world. It is considered the <span>North Pacific</span> equivalent of the largest gull species, the <span>great black-backed gull</span>. measuring 55&#x2013;68.5&#xA0;cm (21.7&#x2013;27.0&#xA0;in) in length, 132&#x2013;160&#xA0;cm (52&#x2013;63&#xA0;in) in wingspan and weighing 1.05&#x2013;1.7&#xA0;kg (2.3&#x2013;3.7&#xA0;lb). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 40.6 to 48&#xA0;cm (16.0 to 18.9&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 4.8 to 6.5&#xA0;cm (1.9 to 2.6&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 6 to 7.6&#xA0;cm (2.4 to 3.0&#xA0;in). It has a white head, belly, and tail with a dark slaty-gray back and wings with a broad white trailing edge. The wings and back are slightly darker than those of the Western Gull. The underside of the wings features a "string of pearls" pattern along their edges; these can be seen from below when the bird is in flight. Its eyes are yellow. The legs are pink and short when compared with those of similar-looking gulls, and the body appears more stout. The bill is yellow with orange-red subterminal spot. Immature gulls' plumage is brown, similar to the that of the <span>great black-backed gull</span>, but paler, and is practically indistinguishable from the immature <span>herring gull</span> in the field.</p>
<p>Like other gulls, the slaty-backed gull is both a forager and a scavenger.</p>
