<p>The <b>common shelduck</b> (<i>Tadorna tadorna</i>) is a <span>waterfowl</span> <span>species</span> shelduck <span>genus</span> <i><span>Tadorna</span></i>. It is widespread and common in <span>Eurasia</span>, mainly breeding in temperate and wintering in subtropical regions; in winter, it can also be found in the <span>Maghreb</span>. Its <span>scientific name</span> comes from Celtic roots and means "pied waterfowl", essentially the same as the <span>English</span> "shelduck".</p>
<p><span>Fossil</span> bones from <span>Dorkovo</span> (<span>Bulgaria</span>) described as <i><b>Balcanas pliocaenica</b></i> may actually belong to this species. More likely, they are an extinct species of <i><span>Tadorna</span></i> (if not a distinct genus) due to their <span>Early Pliocene</span> age; the present species is not unequivocally attested from the fossil record until some 2-3 million years later (<span>Late Pliocene</span>/<span>Early Pleistocene</span>).</p>

<p>The common shelduck resembles a small short-necked goose in size and shape. It is a striking bird, with a reddish-pink bill, pink feet, a white body with chestnut patches and a black belly, and a dark green head and neck. The wing coverts are white, the primary <span>remiges</span> black, and the secondaries green (only showing in flight) and chestnut. The underwings are almost entirely white. Sexes are similar, but the female is smaller, with some white facial markings, while the male is particularly crisply colored in the breeding season, his bill bright red and bearing a prominent knob at the forehead.</p>
<p><span>Ducklings</span> are white, with black cap, hindneck and wing and back patches. Juveniles are similarly colored, greyish above and mostly white below, but already have the adult's wing pattern.</p>
<p>The call is a loud honk.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>This is a <span>bird</span> which breeds in temperate <span>Eurasia</span>. Most populations <span>migrate</span> to subtropical areas in winter, but this species is largely resident in westernmost <span>Europe</span>, apart from movements to favoured moulting grounds, such as the <span>Wadden Sea</span> on the north <span>German</span> coast.</p>
<p>The common shelduck is common around the coastline of <span>Great Britain</span> (where it is simply known as shelduck), where it frequents salt marshes and estuaries. Sightings of this bird are rare in North America and are reported as infrequent visitors to the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Moulting flocks can be very large (100,000 on the Wadden Sea), since most pairs leave their partially grown young in a cr&#xE8;che with just one or two adults.</p>
<p>This species is mainly associated with lakes and rivers in open country, <span>breeding</span> in <span>rabbit</span> burrows, tree holes, haystacks or similar. In winter it is common on suitable estuaries and tidal mudflats as well.</p>
<p>This bird is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>The young will dive under water to avoid predators and the adults will fly away from them to act as a decoy.</p>
