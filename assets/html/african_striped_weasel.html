<p>The <b>African striped weasel</b> (<i>Poecilogale albinucha</i>), the <span>lone member</span> of its <span>genus</span>, is a small, black and white weasel native to <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. It looks very much like a <span>striped polecat</span>, but it is much thinner and has shorter hair. It is a sleek, black color with a white tail and four white stripes running down its back. It is 50&#xA0;cm (20&#xA0;in) in length on average, including its tail of 20&#xA0;cm (7.9&#xA0;in).</p>
<p>The African striped weasel lives in forests, <span>wetlands</span>, and <span>grasslands</span>. It is a <span>nocturnal</span> hunter of small <span>mammals</span>, <span>birds</span>, and reptiles. The weasel kills its <span>prey</span> by whipping its own body and kicking, making use of its thin, lithe, muscular body to stun and tear the <span>prey</span> item. It sometimes stores its prey in its <span>burrow</span> instead of eating it immediately. Like <span>skunks</span> and <span>polecats</span>, the weasel emits a noxious fluid from its anal glands when it feels threatened. The weasel is <span>generally solitary</span>, but individuals have been found sharing burrows. According to African folklore, if one cuts off the nose of a weasel, it will grow back two shades lighter in colour, but it will bring misfortune to your family and lead to a poor harvest. This myth gave birth to expression "A weasel's nose is not to be trifled with."</p>
