<p>The <b>yellow-fronted tinkerbird</b> (<i>Pogoniulus chrysoconus</i>) is a small <span>African barbet</span> formerly known as <b>yellow-fronted tinker barbet</b>. Barbets are <span>near passerine</span> birds with bristles around the base of the bill and a world-wide tropical distribution.</p>
<p>The yellow-fronted tinkerbird is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span>. It is sometimes considered conspecific with its southern counterpart, the <span>red-fronted tinkerbird</span>, <i>Pogoniulus pusillus</i>.</p>
<p>Associated with dry open woodland and scrub, the yellow-fronted tinkerbird eats insects and fruit. The species nests in tree holes and lays two or three eggs.</p>
<p>The yellow-fronted tinkerbird is approximately 11&#xA0;cm (4.3&#xA0;in) in length. It is plump, with a short neck, large head, and short tail. The adult has black upperparts heavlly streaked with yellow and white. Its head has a strong black and white pattern, with a yellow forecrown spot. The underparts and rump are lemon yellow. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but young birds have a differentiating dark crown that lacks the distinct yellow spot.</p>
<p>At about 100 repetitions per minute, the yellow-fronted tinkerbird's call is a fast <i>tink-tink-tink-tink</i>. Many barbets perch prominently, but, unlike their larger relatives, the smaller tinkerbirds sing from cover and are more frequently heard than seen.</p>
<p>Tinkerbirds eat mistletoe fruits (<i>Tapinanthus leendertzia</i>), swallowed whole. The sticky seeds are regurgitated and wiped off on nearby branches. Yellow-fronted tinkerbirds are the most important disperser of mistletoes. On average it needs 172 fruits to satisfy its daily nutritional requirements.</p>
