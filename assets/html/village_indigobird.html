<p>The <b>village indigobird</b> or <b>steelblue widowfinch</b> (<i>Vidua chalybeata</i>) is a small <span>songbird</span> belonging to the family <span>Viduidae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>It is a resident breeding bird in most of Africa south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>This <span>indigobird</span> is found in many open habitats including open woodland, scrub and cultivation, but, as its name implies, it is most readily seen near villages.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cycle_of_life">Cycle of life</span></h2>
<p>It is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nests of <span>red-billed firefinches</span>. Unlike the <span>common cuckoo</span>, it does not destroy the host's egg. Typically, 2-4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the firefinch are white, although the indigobird's are slightly larger. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique <span>gape</span> pattern of the fledglings of the host species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<p>The male village indigobird is territorial, and he has an elaborate courtship flight display. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid sputtering and churring intermingled with mimicry of red-billed firefinch's song, especially the characteristic <i>chick-pea-pea-pea</i>.</p>
<p>The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.</p>

<p>The village indigobird is 11&#x2013;12&#xA0;cm in length. The adult male is entirely greenish-black or bluish-black except for his orange-red legs and conical white bill. The female resembles a female <span>house sparrow</span>, with streaked brown upperparts, buff underparts, a whitish supercilium and a yellowish bill, although she also has red legs. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and without a supercilium.</p>
<p>Many of the indigobirds are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. Helpful pointers with the village indigobird are the association with its host species, the red-billed firefinch, and its presence near human habitation.</p>
