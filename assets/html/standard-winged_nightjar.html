<p>The <b>Standard-winged Nightjar</b> (<i>Macrodipteryx longipennis</i>) is a <span>bird</span> in the <span>nightjar</span> family.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It is a resident breeder in <span>Africa</span> from <span>Senegal</span> east to <span>Ethiopia</span>. It is found in dry savannah habitats, with some scrub.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The adult male has a bizarre wing ornament during the breeding season, with a broad central flight feather on each wing elongated to 38&#xA0;cm, much longer than the bird's body. 20&#xA0;cm or more of this is bare shaft. In normal flight, these feathers trail behind, but in display flight they are raised vertically like standards. Outside the breeding season, there are no plumage distinctions between the male and female.</p>
<p>When roosting on the ground during the day, this medium-sized (20&#x2013;23&#xA0;cm long) nightjar is mainly variegated grey, with a browner collar. It is a shadowy form with easy, silent <span>moth</span>-like flight; this nightjar is relatively short-tailed, and lacks white in the wings or tail. The song is a churring trill.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Like other nightjars, the Standard-winged Nightjar feeds on insects in flight, the huge gape opening wide for <span>moths</span> and <span>beetles</span>. It flies at dusk, most often at sundown, and can sometimes be seen with <span>Flying Foxes</span>.</p>
<p>No nest is made; the two elongated and elliptical eggs are placed upon the bare ground.</p>
