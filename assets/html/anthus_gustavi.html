<p>The <b>Pechora pipit</b> (<i>Anthus gustavi</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> which breeds in the <span>tundra</span> of northern <span>Asia</span>, eastwards of <span>Russia</span>. It is a long-distance <span>migrant</span>, moving in winter to <span>Indonesia</span>. Rarely in September and October, the Pechora pipit may be observed in western Europe.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
<p><i>A. gustavi</i> is a small <span>pipit</span>, which somewhat resembles the non-breeding <span>red-throated pipit</span>. The species is heavily streaked brown above, with whitish mantle stripes, and with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from red-throated by its heavier bill, whiter mantle stripes, and contrast between its buff breast and white belly.</p>
<p>This species creeps in long grass, and is reluctant to fly even when disturbed. Its call is a distinctive electrical <i>zip</i>. Although the call is generally helpful when identifying pipits, this species calls far less than most. This, combined with its <span>skulking</span> habits, makes this a difficult species to find and identify away from its breeding grounds in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Probably the best place in western Europe to see this rare species is <span>Fair Isle</span>, <span>Shetland</span>. The lack of cover on this small island makes skulking passerines easier to find.</p>
<p>The breeding habitat is damp tundra, open forest or marshland. The nest is on the ground, with 4&#x2013;5 eggs being laid. This species is <span>insectivorous</span>, like its relatives.</p>
<p>The scientific name commemorates the <span>Dutch</span> naturalist <span>Gustaaf Schlegel</span>.</p>
