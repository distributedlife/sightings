<p>The <b>Arctic warbler</b> (<i>Phylloscopus borealis</i>) is a widespread <span>leaf warbler</span> in <span>birch</span> or mixed birch forest near water throughout its breeding range in <span>Fennoscandia</span> and northern <span>Asia</span>. It has established a foothold in <span>North America</span>, breeding in <span>Alaska</span>. This warbler is strongly <span>migratory</span>; the entire population winters in southeast Asia. It therefore has one of the longest migrations of any <span>Old World</span> insectivorous bird.</p>
<p>It traditionally included populations that breed in <span>Kamchatka</span>, the <span>Kuril Islands</span> and <span>Japan</span>, but <span>genetic</span> and vocal evidence strongly suggested these should be treated as separate species, and are all now considered distinct with the <span>Kamchatka leaf warbler</span> in Kamchatka, <span>Hokkaido</span> and the Kuril Islands, and the <span>Japanese leaf warbler</span> in Japan (except Hokkaido).</p>
<p>The nest is on the ground in a low shrub. Like most Old World warblers, this small <span>passerine</span> is insectivorous.</p>
<p>This is a typical leaf warbler in appearance, greyish-green above and off-white below. Its single wing bar distinguishes it from most similar <span>species</span> except the <span>greenish warbler</span>, <i>Phylloscopus trochiloides</i>. It is larger than that species and has a heavier, dagger-like bill, with a dark tip to the lower mandible. Its song is a fast trill.</p>
<p>This species occurs as an autumn vagrant in western <span>Europe</span> and is annual in <span>Great Britain</span>.</p>
