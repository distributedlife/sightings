<p><b>Hopkins's groove-toothed swamp rat</b> (<b><i>Pelomys hopkinsi</i> Hayman, 1955</b>) is a species of <span>rodent</span> in the family <span>Muridae</span>. It is found in <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Rwanda</span>, <span>Uganda</span>, possibly <span>Burundi</span>, and possibly <span>Tanzania</span>. Its natural <span>habitat</span> is <span>swamps</span>. It is threatened by <span>habitat loss</span>.</p>
<p>The rat was described by <span>Robert William Hayman</span> in 1955. It is named after the entomologist, <span>George Henry Evans Hopkins</span>, O.B.E., M.A., F.R.E.S. (1898-1973), who lived and worked in Uganda for many years, and was noted for his researches on three groups of insects: lice, fleas and mosquitoes. Hopkins had collaborated with Hayman and <span>Reginald Ernest Moreau</span> in the publication of &#x201C;The type-localities of some African mammals&#x201D; in <i>The Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</i> in 1946.</p>
