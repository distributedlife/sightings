<p>The <b>African pipit</b> (<i>Anthus cinnamomeus</i>) is a fairly small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> belonging to the <span>pipit</span> genus <i>Anthus</i> in the family <span>Motacillidae</span>. It is also known as the <b>grassveld pipit</b> or <b>grassland pipit</b>. It was formerly lumped together with the <span>Richard's</span>, <span>Australasian</span>, <span>mountain</span> and <span>paddyfield pipits</span> in a single species, Richard's pipit (<i>Anthus novaeseelandiae</i>), but is now often treated as a species in its own right.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>It occurs in grassland and fields in <span>Southern</span>, <span>Central</span> and <span>East</span> <span>Africa</span>, south-east of a line from <span>Angola</span> through the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> to <span>Sudan</span>. It is also found in south-western <span>Arabia</span>. There is an isolated population in the highlands of <span>Cameroon</span> which is sometimes considered to be a separate species: <b>Cameroon pipit</b> (<i>Anthus camaroonensis</i>).</p>

<p>The African pipit is 15 to 17&#xA0;cm long and is a slender bird with an erect stance. It is buffy-brown above with darker streaks. The underparts are white or pale buff with a streaked breast and plain belly and flanks. The face is boldly patterned with a pale stripe over the eye and a dark malar stripe. The outer tail-feathers are white. The legs are long and pinkish and the slender <span>bill</span> is dark with a yellowish base to the lower mandible. <span>Juvenile</span> birds have a blotched breast, scalloping on the upperparts and some streaking on the flanks.</p>
<p>The <span>song</span> is a repeated series of twittering notes, given during an undulating song-flight or from a low perch.</p>
<p>The Cameroon pipit is slightly larger and darker with buff underparts.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p><span>BirdLife International</span> has <span>lumped</span> the African pipit with Richard's pipit, and therefore has given it no separate conservation status. However, Zimmerman, Turner, and Pearson (1999) call it "the common East African pipit."</p>
