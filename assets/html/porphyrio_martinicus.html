<p>The <b>Purple Gallinule</b> (<i>Porphyrio martinicus</i>) is a "swamp hen" in the <span>rail</span> family Rallidae. Also known locally as the <b>Yellow-legged Gallinule</b>.</p>
<p>This is a medium-sized rail, measuring 26&#x2013;37&#xA0;cm (10&#x2013;15&#xA0;in) in length, spanning 50&#x2013;61&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;24&#xA0;in) across the wings and weighing 141&#x2013;305&#xA0;g (5.0&#x2013;10.8&#xA0;oz). Males, averaging 257&#xA0;g (9.1&#xA0;oz) in mass, are slightly larger than females, at 215&#xA0;g (7.6&#xA0;oz) on average. The adult Purple gallinule has big yellow feet, purple-blue <span>plumage</span> with a green back, and red and yellow bill. It has a pale blue forehead shield and white undertail. Darkness or low light can dim the bright purple-blue plumage of the adult to make them look dusky or brownish, although the forehead shield color differentiates them from similar species such as <span>Common Gallinules</span>.</p>
<p>Juveniles are brown overall with a brownish olive back. These gallinules will fly short distances with dangling legs.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is warm swamps and marshes in <span>southeastern states</span> of the <span>United States</span> and the tropical regions of <span>Central America</span>, the <span>Caribbean</span> and northern <span>South America</span>. This species is resident in southern <span>Florida</span> and the tropics, but most American birds are <span>migratory</span>, wintering south to <span>Argentina</span>.</p>
<p>The nest is a floating structure in a marsh. Five to ten <span>eggs</span> are laid. Their coloration is buff with brown spots.</p>
<p>They are omnivorous - their diet being known to include a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including <span>seeds</span>, leaves and <span>fruits</span> of both aquatic and terrestrial plants, as well as <span>insects</span>, <span>frogs</span>, <span>snails</span>, <span>spiders</span>, <span>earthworms</span> and <span>fish</span>. They have also been known to eat the eggs and young of other birds.</p>
<p>This species is a very rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span> and southwestern Africa. There is a similarly named species in Europe, Asia and Africa, the <span>Purple Swamphen</span>, <i>Porphyrio porphyrio</i>, but that bird is much larger.</p>
