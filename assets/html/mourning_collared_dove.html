<p>The <b>Mourning Collared Dove</b> (<i>Streptopelia decipiens</i>) is a <span>pigeon</span> which is a widespread resident breeding bird in <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. Despite its name, it is not a close relative of the <span>North American</span> <span>Mourning Dove</span>, <i>Zenaida macroura</i>. This species is common or abundant near water. They often mingle peacefully with other doves.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Mourning Collared Dove is a largish, stocky pigeon, up to 31&#xA0;cm in length. Its back, wings and tail are pale brown. The head is grey and the underparts are pink, shading to pale grey on the belly. There is a black hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red.</p>
<p>When flying, it shows blackish flight feathers and extensive white in the tail, the latter being a distinction from the similar but larger <span>Red-eyed Dove</span>. The call is a fast <i>krrrrrrrr, oo-OO, oo</i>.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, but immatures are duller than adults, and have scalloping on the body <span>feathers</span>.</p>

<p>The Mourning Collared Dove's flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet_and_feeding">Diet and feeding</span></h3>
<p>Mourning Collared Doves eat grass seeds, grains and other vegetation. They are quite terrestrial, and usually forage on the ground. Unlike several other species in this genus, they are quite gregarious and often feed in groups.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>It builds a stick nest in a tree, often a <span>mangrove</span>, and lays two white <span>eggs</span>.</p>
