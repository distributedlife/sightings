<p>The <b>brown snake eagle</b> (<i>Circaetus cinereus</i>) is a species of <span>bird of prey</span> in the <span>Accipitridae</span> family. found in Southern and Eastern Africa, in countries such as <span>Sudan</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Mauritania</span> and <span>Senegal</span>.</p>
<p>The brown snake eagle feeds mainly with snakes, being able to kill poisonous snakes such as cobras. They have natural protection against bites, with thick skin on legs. Besides snakes, the brown snake eagle feeds on lizards and small mammals.</p>
<p>Like other species of <span>snake eagles</span>, they lay only one egg per year, which is mainly incubated by the female.</p>
<p>The brown snake eagle is of average size, compared with larger species, such as the <span>bald eagle</span>, reaching only 60-70 centimeters in height. They also live less, only 7-10 years.</p>
<p>The brown snake eagle prefers the nests made by other birds. They usually take deserted and partially destroyed nests, which they prefer to repair. If they need to build a new one, they choose a tree or a high rock, far from the habitat of predators and from human settlements.</p>
<p>Their plumage is entirely brown, but some of them could have some white feathers. The juvenile eagles stay around the nest for 60-100 days, until they <span>fledge</span>. The juvenile brown snake eagle is completely independent a few weeks after fledging.</p>
