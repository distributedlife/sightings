<p>The <b>African forest elephant</b> (<i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>) is a forest-dwelling species of <span>elephant</span> found in the <span>Congo Basin</span>. It is the smallest of the three <span>extant</span> species of elephant, but also the third-largest living terrestrial animal. The African forest elephant and the <span>African bush elephant</span> were considered to be one species until genetic studies showed their relationship is distant.</p>

<p>The African forest elephant was once considered to be a <span>subspecies</span>, <i>Loxodonta africana cyclotis</i>, of the <span>African elephant</span>, together with the <span>African bush elephant</span>. <span>DNA</span> tests, however, indicated the two populations were much more genetically diverse than previously believed. In 2010, a genetic study confirmed they are separate species which diverged from each other an estimated two to seven million years ago.</p>
<p>The disputed <span>pygmy elephants</span> of the Congo Basin, often assumed to be a separate species (<i>Loxodonta pumilio</i>) by <span>cryptozoologists</span>, are probably forest elephants whose diminutive size or early maturity is due to environmental conditions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Compared to the bush elephant, the African forest elephant has a longer, narrower <span>mandible</span> and its ears are more rounded. Its <span>tusks</span> are straighter and harder and have a pinkish tinge. It also has a different number of toenails &#x2014; normally five on the forefoot and four on the hindfoot, like the <span>Asian elephant</span> but unlike the African bush elephant which normally has four toenails on the forefoot and three on the hindfoot.</p>
<p>A male African forest elephant rarely exceeds 2.5&#xA0;m (8&#xA0;ft) in height, considerably smaller than the bush species which is usually over 3 m (just under 10&#xA0;ft) and sometimes almost 4&#xA0;m (13&#xA0;ft) tall. <i>L. cyclotis</i> reportedly weighs around 2.7 tonnes (5,950&#xA0;lb), with the largest specimens attaining 6 tonnes (13,230&#xA0;lb). <span>Pygmy elephants</span> of the Congo Basin, presumed to be a subgroup of <i>L. cyclotis</i>, have reportedly weighed as little as 900&#xA0;kg (1,980&#xA0;lb) as adults.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet_and_ecological_role">Diet and ecological role</span></h2>
<p>The African forest elephant is a <span>herbivore</span>, and commonly eats <span>leaves</span>, <span>fruit</span>, and <span>bark</span>, with occasional visits to <span>mineral licks</span>. It eats a high proportion of fruit, and is sometimes the only disperser of some tree species, such as <i><span>Balanites</span> wilsoniana</i> and <i><span>Omphalocarpum</span></i> spp. Elephants have been referred to as "forest gardeners" due to their significant role in seed dispersal and maintaining plant diversity.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>Late in the 20th century, conservation workers established a DNA identification system to trace the origin of poached ivory. Due to <span>poaching</span> to meet high demand for <span>ivory</span>, the African forest elephant population approached critical levels in the 1990s and early 2000s. Over several decades, numbers are estimated to have fallen from approximately 700,000 to less than 100,000, with about half of the remaining population in Gabon. In May 2013, <span>Sudanese</span> poachers invaded the <span>Central African Republic</span>'s <span>Dzanga Bai World Heritage Site</span> and killed 26 elephants. Communications equipment, video cameras, and additional training of park guards were provided following the massacre to improve protection of the site. In September 2013, it was estimated that the forest elephant could become extinct within ten years. From mid-April to mid-June 2014, poachers killed 68 elephants in <span>Garamba National Park</span>, including young ones without tusks.</p>
<p>Civil unrest, human encroachment, and habit fragmentation leaves some elephants confined to small patches of forest without sufficient food. In January 2014, <span>IFAW</span> undertook a relocation project at the request of the <span>C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire</span> government, moving four elephants from <span>Daloa</span> to <span>Azagny National Park</span>.</p>
