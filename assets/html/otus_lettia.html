<p>The <b>collared scops owl</b> (<i>Otus lettia</i>) is an <span>owl</span> which is a resident breeder in south Asia from northern <span>Pakistan</span>, northern <span>India</span> and the <span>Himalayas</span> east to south <span>China</span>. It is partially <span>migratory</span>, with some birds wintering in <span>India</span>, <span>Sri Lanka</span> and <span>Malaysia</span>. This species was formerly considered to be included within what is now separated as the <span>Indian scops owl</span> (<i>Otus bakkamoena</i>).</p>
<p>This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as <span>typical owls</span>, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the <span>barn owls</span>, Tytonidae.</p>
<p>The collared scops owl is a common breeding bird in forests and other well-wooded areas. It nests in a hole in a tree, laying 3-5 <span>eggs</span>.</p>
<p>The collared scops owl is a small (23&#x2013;25&#xA0;cm) owl, although it is the largest of the <span>scops owls</span>. Like other scops owls, it has small head tufts, or <i>ears</i>. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the <span>subspecies</span>, with faint <span>buff</span> spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking.</p>
<p>The facial disc is whitish or buff, and the eyes are orange or brown. There is a buff neckband. Sexes are similar. The flight is deeply undulating.</p>
<p>This species is nocturnal but it can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. It feeds mainly on <span>insects</span>. The call is a quiet <i>goog gook</i>.</p>
<p>This species is chiefly found in northern India and is replaced by the very similar looking <span>oriental scops owl</span> <i>Otus sunia</i> (recently split) towards the south of its range. It is very similar also to the slightly smaller <span>Indian scops owl</span>, <i>O. bakkamoena</i>. They are most easily separated in the field by their calls.</p>
