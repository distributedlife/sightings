<p>The <b>Croaking Cisticola</b> (<i>Cisticola natalensis</i>) is an <span>Old World warbler</span> in the genus <i><span>Cisticola</span></i>. This genus is sometimes split off with various other southern warbler genera and given family status as the Cisticolidae.</p>
<p>The Croaking Cisticola is a resident breeder in <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara</span>. It is a very small insectivorous <span>bird</span>.</p>
<p>These small <span>passerines</span> are found in rank grassland habitats, often near swamps or water. Male cisticolas are polygamous; the female builds a discreet nest deep in the grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of <span>felted</span> plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The Croaking Cisticola's nest is a ball shape with a side entrance; 2-4 eggs are laid.</p>
<p>This is the largest cisticola. This warbler is grey-brown above, heavily streaked with black. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, pale-tipped and flicked frequently. It has a chestnut wing-panel and a heavy bill.</p>
<p>It is very similar to other members of its genus. It is best distinguished from its many African relatives by its size and froglike croaking <i>breep-breep</i> song. The song is always the easiest identification criterion for this genus.</p>
<p>These birds are more easily heard than seen, and because of their small size (about 14&#xA0;cm) not always easy to recognise, particularly outside the breeding season when they seldom emerge from their grasses.</p>
