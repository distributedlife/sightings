<p><b>Swinhoe's storm petrel</b> (<i>Oceanodroma monorhis</i>), also known as <b>Swinhoe's petrel</b>, is a small, all-brown <span>seabird</span> of the <span>storm petrel</span> family <span>Hydrobatidae</span>.</p>
<p>It breeds on islands in the northwest <span>Pacific</span> off <span>China</span>, <span>Japan</span> and <span>Korea</span>. It nests in colonies close to the sea in rock crevices and lays a single white egg. It spends the rest of the year at sea, ranging into the <span>Indian Ocean</span> and <span>Arabian Sea</span>.</p>
<p>The common name commemorates the British naturalist <span>Robert Swinhoe</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Swinhoe's storm petrel is a small <span>bird</span>, 18&#x2013;21&#xA0;cm in length with a 45&#x2013;48&#xA0;cm wingspan, though distinctly larger than the <span>European storm petrel</span>. It is essentially dark brown in all plumages, and has a fluttering flight, pattering on the water surface as it picks <span>planktonic</span> food items from the ocean surface. Unlike the European storm petrel, it does not follow ships.</p>
<p>In structure it most resembles a <span>Leach's storm petrel</span> with its forked tail, longish wings, and flight behaviour, but does not have a white rump and the call differs. It is difficult to distinguish from other all-dark <i>Oceanodroma</i> species, and the first <span>English</span> record had to be <span>DNA</span>-tested to eliminate the possibility that it was a Leach's storm petrel, since populations of north-eastern Pacific Leach's storm petrels contain individuals that show completely dark rumps.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits_and_observation">Habits and observation</span></h2>
<p>This <span>storm petrel</span> is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by <span>gulls</span> and <span>skuas</span>, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. It is strictly <span>pelagic</span> outside the breeding season, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes Swinhoe's petrel a difficult bird to see from land. Only in storms might this species be pushed into headlands, but even then an out of range bird would probably defy definite identification.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>Widespread throughout its large range, the Swinhoe's storm petrel was previously evaluated as <span>least concern</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</span>, but was uplisted to <span>near threatened</span> in 2012.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="North_Atlantic_status">North Atlantic status</span></h2>
<p>On 8 July 1983, a bird was trapped on the Selvagens, <span>Madeira</span> and was confirmed to be the first record for the Atlantic Ocean. Since then a number of storm petrels exhibiting plumage and structural characteristics have been recorded at sea, principally in the <span>North Atlantic</span>, while birds were trapped during the summer months in France (1989), England (1989 (two birds), 1990 (with birds retrapped from 1991 to 1994)), Spain (1994), Norway (1996, 1997), and again Madeira (1991, 1994). Other than the east <span>North Atlantic</span> and the <span>Mediterranean Sea</span> a number of other individuals have been identified in the western North Atlantic. Records of single birds off <span>Hatteras, North Carolina</span>, on 20 August 1993, on 8 August 1998, and 2 June 2008 have all been accepted as valid North American records.</p>
