<p>The <b>white-throated swallow</b> (<i>Hirundo albigularis</i>) is a small bird in the <span>swallow</span> <span>family</span>. It is a common species, found in southern Africa, which has benefited from the increased nesting opportunities presented by the construction of bridges and dams.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The white-throated swallow is 14&#x2013;17&#xA0;cm long. It has glossy dark blue upperparts and a bright chestnut crown. A dark blue-black breast band separates the white throat from the greyish white underparts and underwing coverts. The upper wings, underwing flight feathers and forked tail are blackish-blue, but the undertail has white patches near the feather tips. The white throat and blackish breast band are distinctions from similar <i><span>Hirundo</span></i> species. The outer feathers are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller than the adult, with shorter outer tail feathers and a browner crown. The call is a mix of warbles and twitters.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The swallow breeds in southern <span>Africa</span> from <span>Angola</span> and <span>Zambia</span> southwards to the <span>Cape</span> in <span>South Africa</span>. It is mainly <span>migratory</span>, wintering in Angola, Zambia and southern <span>Zaire</span>. This is a bird of open country and grassland, with a preference for highlands and nearby water. It is often found around man-made structures.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The white-throated swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a soft lining of grass or hair. It is usually near or over water, and is built on a ledge under an overhang on a rock face or on a man-made structure such as a building, dam wall, culvert or bridge. Uninhabited buildings are preferred to houses. The nest may be reused for subsequent broods or in later years.</p>
<p>The three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and blue blotches, and are incubated by the female alone for 15&#x2013;16 days to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 20&#x2013;21 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight. The young can swim a short distance to safety if they fall from the nest.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>It feeds mainly on flying insects, which it pursues with a fast twisting flight like a <span>barn swallow</span>.</p>
