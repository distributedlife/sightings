<p>The <b>rufous-tailed robin</b> (<i>Luscinia sibilans</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> bird. Its breeding range extends from southern <span>Siberia</span> and the <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span> to southern China and southeastern Asia.</p>
<p>It has a number of alternative <span>English names</span>: <b>pseudorobin</b>, <b>red-tailed robin</b>, <b>Swinhoe's red-tailed robin</b>, <b>Swinhoe's robin</b>, <b>Swinhoe's pseudorobin</b>, <b>Swinhoe's nightingale</b> or <b>whistling nightingale</b>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The rufous-tailed robin was formerly classed as a member of the <span>thrush</span> family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to belong to the <span>Old World flycatchers</span>, Muscicapidae. It and similar small Old World species are often called <span>chats</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Morphology">Morphology</span></h2>
<p>The rufous-tailed robin is much the same size as the <span>European robin</span> at 14&#xA0;cm (5.5&#xA0;in) length. It is plain greyish brown above and grey to white below, with circular pale markings on its heavily mottled throat and breast. It has a bright rufous rump and tail. The flanks are buff and there is whitish ring round the eye and a pronounced buffish cheek stripe. The tip of the lower mandible is slightly upturned. The beak is brownish-black and the legs pinkish-grey. The sexes generally look alike but the females may be marginally paler. Juveniles are similar to the adults but tinged with ochre and with dark edges to the upper plumage. At first glance this bird could be confused with the American <i>Catharus</i> <span>thrushes</span> such as <span>Veery</span> and <span>Hermit Thrush</span>.</p>
<p>The male rufous-tailed robin sings by day, but also by night during the breeding season. The song consists of several similar phrases, being loud cascading trills starting at a high pitch and ending lower, rather like the neigh of a horse. Calls include whistles when the bird is alarmed and a jangling &#x201C;chok-chok&#x201D; when the parents have young to care for.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The rufous-tailed robin is a <span>migratory</span> insectivorous species breeding in forests in the <span>taiga</span> of northeastern Asia and south to <span>Mongolia</span>, and wintering in Southeast Asia and southern China. It is a rare vagrant to Western Europe. The first record for this bird in Europe was on <span>Fair Isle</span>, Scotland in October 2004. Another was seen in <span>Poland</span> in January 2006. More recently, it was seen in <span>Norfolk</span>, England in October 2011 and again in September 2013, and in Denmark in October 2012.</p>
<p>It is a bird of <span>coniferous</span> woodlands and damp broad-leafed woodland with fallen trees and thick undergrowth, particularly <span>spruce</span> and <span>fir</span> with <span>willow</span>, <span>alder</span>, <span>birch</span>, <span>poplar</span> and <span>bird cherry</span>. It is mainly a lowland species but sometimes occurs at altitudes of up to 1,200&#xA0;m (4,000&#xA0;ft) above sea level. In its winter quarters it is found in forests, in areas with scattered trees, scrubland, parks and gardens.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>This is an elusive bird and difficult to spot as it lurks among concealing branches, remaining stationary for considerable periods. It is terrestrial in its habits and <span>insectivorous</span>, mainly feeding on ants, beetles, spiders and other invertebrates. It often flicks its tail in a characteristic way.</p>
<p>Breeding takes place in June or July. The nest is cup-shaped and is often in a hole in a tree or on a stump and usually quite near the ground. It is made from dead leaves, grasses and moss and lined with finer materials. There are usually five or six eggs, either plain pale blue or blueish-grey irregularly blotched with brown. Migration southwards starts soon after the nestlings are reared, in late August in Russia and a few weeks later in Korea. The birds arrive in the vicinity of <span>Hong Kong</span> in November and also overwinter in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. In the spring they move northwards again, reaching Korea in May and Russia by early June.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The rufous-tailed robin is considered by the <span>IUCN</span> to be of "<span>Least Concern</span>". This is because it has an extremely large range, appears to be quite common within that range and the population seems to be stable.</p>
