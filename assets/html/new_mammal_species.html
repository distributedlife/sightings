				<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Although the <span>mammals</span> are well studied in comparison to other animal groups, a number of new species are still being discovered. This list includes <span>extant</span> <span>mammal</span> <span>species</span> discovered, formally named, or brought to public light in the year 2000 or later. Notable <span>subspecies</span> are also included, as are mammals rediscovered after being declared, or seriously suspected to be, <span>extinct</span>.</p>
<p>Newly discovered fossils are not included.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Marsupials">Marsupials</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Marsupials described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>At least five new species of marsupials have been discovered since 2000:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Elephants">Elephants</span></h2>
<p>In 2001, genetic evidence emerged that the African elephant (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>), once thought to be a single species, was in fact two, as the smaller <span>African forest elephant</span> was in fact a distinct species (<i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>). <i>L. africana</i> is now commonly referred to as the <span>African bush elephant</span>. Strictly speaking, this is not a newly discovered species, but simply an alternative <span>taxonomic</span> treatment, as <i>cyclotis</i> already was widely recognized, but only as a <span>subspecies</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sloths">Sloths</span></h2>
<p>The <span>pygmy three-toed sloth</span> (<i>Bradypus pygmaeus</i>) was named in 2001, after its discovery in the <span>mangrove</span> <span>swamps</span> of <span>Isla Escudo de Veraguas</span>, a tiny island off the western coast of <span>Panama</span>. They weigh 40% less than mainland <span>sloths</span>, are 20% smaller, and have a distinctive fringe of long hair.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Primates">Primates</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Primates described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>Since 2000, at least 25 new species of primate have been described&#x2014;16 <span>lemurs</span> and nine <span>monkeys</span>, including the golden palace monkey or <span>Madidi titi</span>, named by auction.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lagomorphs">Lagomorphs</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Lagomorphs described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>Three species of <span>lagomorph</span> have been described in the 21st century: the <span>black pika</span>, <i>Ochotona nigritia</i>, the <span>Venezuelan lowland rabbit</span>, <i>Sylvilagus varynaensis</i>, and the <span>Annamite striped rabbit</span>, <i>Nesolagus timminsi</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rodents">Rodents</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Rodents described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>A number of rodents are described each year. Notable among those described since 2000 are the <span>Cypriot mouse</span>, <i>Mus cypriacus</i>, and the <span>Laotian rock rat</span>, <i>Laonastes aenigmamus</i>, which represents a family (<span>Diatomyidae</span>) thought to be extinct since the <span>Miocene</span>, and has been described as a <span>living fossil</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bats">Bats</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Bats described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>At least 30 new species of bat have been described since 2000. The new species were found in Africa, Latin America, Asia, Oceania, and Europe.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Even-toed_ungulates"><span>Even-toed ungulates</span></span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Cetartiodactyls described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>Since 2000, several new species of cetartiodactyl have been described, including three aquatic species (<span>Australian snubfin dolphin</span>, <span>Perrin's beaked whale</span>, and <span>Omura's whale</span>) and three terrestrial ungulates (<span>Roosevelt's muntjac</span>, <span>giant forest peccary</span> and the <span>yellow-striped chevrotain</span>). Additionally, the <span>northern right whale</span>, previously considered a single species, was proposed split into a <span>Pacific</span> and an <span>Atlantic</span> species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Carnivorans">Carnivorans</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <span>Carnivorans described in the 2000s</span></div>
<p>Several new subspecies of previously known species were described. Additionally, an alternative taxonomic treatment of the clouded leopard was proposed, in which the <span>taxon</span> <i>diardi</i>, previously considered a subspecies of <i><span>Neofelis nebulosa</span></i>, was proposed a separate species, the <span>Bornean clouded leopard</span> (<i>Neofelis diardi</i>). In 2013, the <span>olinguito</span>, living in the Andean <span>cloud forest</span>, was determined to be a distinct species. It had previously been categorized as a small <span>olingo</span>.</p>
