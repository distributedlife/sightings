<p>The <b>dark-sided flycatcher</b> (<i>Muscicapa sibirica</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Muscicapa</span></i> in the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> family Muscicapidae. It has a wide distribution in <span>Asia</span> with northern birds migrating south for the winter. It is also known as the <b>Siberian flycatcher</b> or <b>sooty flycatcher</b>, the latter name is also used for the <span>sooty flycatcher</span> (<i>M. infuscata</i>) of <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is 13 to 14&#xA0;cm long. The upperparts are plain and dark grey-brown apart from a pale wingbar and pale edging to the <span>tertial</span> feathers. The breast and flanks have a variable amount of streaky dark grey-brown. This is unlike the similar <span>Asian brown flycatcher</span> which has rather plain pale underparts and the <span>grey-streaked flycatcher</span> which is white below with distinct grey streaks.</p>
<p>Dark-sided flycatchers have a pale submoustachial stripe and a dark malar stripe which outlines the white throat and half-collar. The centre of the lower breast and belly is white while the undertail-coverts are white with dark centres to the feathers. The bill is short and dark and the feet are black. The eye is large and has a whitish ring around it. The wings are long with a longer <span>primary</span> projection than the Asian brown flycatcher.</p>
<p>The adults of both sexes are alike but <span>juveniles</span> have pale spots on the upperparts, a mottled breast and buff tips to the wing-coverts.</p>
<p>The <span>song</span> is a series of thin, high-pitched notes with trills and whistles. The call is a metallic tinkling.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The <span>subspecies</span> <i>M. s. sibirica</i> breeds in south-east <span>Siberia</span> westward to beyond <span>Lake Baikal</span> as well as in <span>Mongolia</span>, north-east <span>China</span>, <span>North Korea</span> and <span>Japan</span> (<span>Hokkaid&#x14D;</span> and northern <span>Honsh&#x16B;</span>). <i>M. s. rothschildi</i> breeds in western China and <span>Myanmar</span>. <i>M. s. gulmergi</i> occurs from <span>Afghanistan</span> to <span>Kashmir</span> with <i>M. s. cacabata</i> from the eastern <span>Himalayas</span> to south-east <span>Tibet</span> and perhaps Myanmar.</p>
<p>The wintering range includes north-east <span>India</span>, <span>Bangladesh</span>, southern China, <span>Taiwan</span> and <span>South-east Asia</span> as far as <span>Sumatra</span>, <span>Java</span>, <span>Borneo</span> and the <span>Philippines</span> (<span>Palawan</span> and <span>Culion</span>). <span>Vagrant</span> birds have been recorded in <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Bermuda</span>.</p>
<p>It inhabits <span>coniferous</span> and <span>mixed forest</span> and woodland and is sometimes seen in plantations, parks and gardens. It typically occurs in mountainous regions, reaching 4000 metres above sea-level in some areas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Like other flycatchers, its feeding technique is to perch on an exposed branch and wait. When an <span>insect</span> flies past, the bird dashes out to snatch it.</p>
<p>It builds a cup-shaped <span>nest</span> 2 to 18 metres above the ground, on the branch of a tree or sometimes in a hole. Three to five <span>eggs</span> are laid; these are pale green with reddish markings.</p>
