<p>The <b>thick-billed warbler</b> (<i>Iduna aedon)</i> is an <span>Old World warbler</span> that breeds in temperate east <span>Asia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in tropical south east Asia. It is a very rare vagrant to western <span>Europe</span>.</p>
<p>This <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> is a species found in dense vegetation such as reeds, bushes and thick undergrowth. 5-6 <span>eggs</span> are laid in a nest in a low tree.</p>
<p>This is a large warbler, at 16&#x2013;17.5 centimetres (6.3&#x2013;6.9&#xA0;in) long nearly as big as <span>great reed warbler</span>. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts, with few obvious distinctive <span>plumage</span> features. The forehead is rounded, and the bill is short and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are richer buff below. Like most warblers, it is <span>insectivorous</span>, but will take other small prey items.</p>
<p>The song is fast and loud, and similar to <span>marsh warbler</span>, with much mimicry and typically acrocephaline whistles added.</p>
<p>It was sometimes placed in the monotypic genus <i>Phragmaticola</i> (or <i>Phragamaticola</i>) and for a long time as <i>Acrocephalus</i> and in 2009 found to belong to the <i>Iduna</i> clade.</p>
