<p>The <b>brown-eared bulbul</b> (<i>Hypsipetes amaurotis</i>) is a medium-sized <span>bulbul</span> which is found from the <span>Russian Far East</span> (including <span>Sakhalin</span>), northeastern <span>China</span>, the <span>Korean Peninsula</span>, and <span>Japan</span>, south to <span>Taiwan</span> and the <span>Babuyan</span> and <span>Batanes</span> island chains in the north of the <span>Philippines</span>, occasionally being found on <span>Luzon</span>. It is extremely common within the northern parts of its range and is a familiar bird throughout Japan, where it is called <i><b>hiyodori</b></i> (&#x30D2;&#x30E8;&#x30C9;&#x30EA;), and Korea, where it is known as <i><b>jikbakguri</b></i> (&#xC9C1;&#xBC15;&#xAD6C;&#xB9AC;). In <span>Taiwan</span>, on the other hand, it is rare and limited to <span>Orchid Island</span> .</p>
<p>Reaching a length of about 28&#xA0;cm (11&#xA0;in), brown-eared bulbuls are grayish-brown, with brown cheeks (the "brown ears" of the common name) and a long tail. While they prefer forested areas, they readily adapt to urban and rural environments, and their noisy squeaking calls are a familiar sound in most areas of Japan.</p>
<p>Historically, brown-eared bulbuls were <span>migratory</span> birds moving to the southern parts of its range in winter, but they have taken advantage of changes in crops and farming practices in recent decades to overwinter in areas farther north than previously possible. As a result, they are considered agricultural pests in some areas of Japan. Most brown-eared bulbuls still move south in winter, often forming huge flocks during migration. In summer, brown-eared bulbuls primarily feed on insects, while they primarily take fruits and seeds in the fall and winter.</p>
