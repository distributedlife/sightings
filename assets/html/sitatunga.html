<p>The <b>sitatunga</b> or <b>marshbuck</b> (<i>Tragelaphus spekii</i>) is a <span>swamp-dwelling</span> <span>antelope</span> found throughout <span>Central Africa</span>, centering on the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Cameroon</span> and parts of <span>Southern Sudan</span> as well as in <span>Ghana</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, <span>Gabon</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Uganda</span> and <span>Kenya</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The <span>scientific name</span> of the sitatunga is <i>Tragelaphus spekii</i>. Formerly included in the <span>genus</span> <i>Limnotragus</i>,  the animal is presently placed under the genus <i><span>Tragelaphus</span></i> and in the <span>family</span> <span>Bovidae</span>. Within <i>Tragelaphus</i>, the <span>bushbuck</span>, sitatunga and <span>nyala</span> are particularly close relatives. The sitatunga is almost indistinguishable from the nyala, except by <span>pelage</span> and <span>spoor</span>. The sitatunga and bushbuck are genetically similar enough to <span>hybridise</span>. Hybrids between the <span>bongo</span> and sitatunga have proved to be fertile.</p>
<p>The species was <span>first described</span> by English explorer <span>John Hanning Speke</span> in 1863. Speke first observed the sitatunga at a lake named "Little Windermere" (presently known as Lake Lwelo, located in <span>Kagera</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>). In his book <i>Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile</i>, Speke called the animal "nzo&#xE9;" or "water-boc" (due to its resemblance to the <span>waterbuck</span>), and added in a footnote that the species had been named <i>Tragelaphus spekii</i> by <span>Philip Sclater</span>. However, according to Article 50.1.1 of the <span>International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</span> and <span>International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</span>, this is insufficient to state Sclater as the author. Speke pointed out in his book that though "closely allied" to the waterbuck, the sitatunga lacks stripes and is spotted instead. The toes are long, and the coat well-adapted to its moist habitat.</p>
<p>The sitatunga is more variable in its general characters than any other member of the <span>tribe</span> <span>Strepsicerotini</span>, probably because of their confinement to swampy and marshy habitats. On the basis of physical characteristics such as hair texture, coat colour and the presence or absence of stripes, three subspecies of the sitatunga have been recognised:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The sitatunga is a medium-sized antelope. It is <span>sexually dimorphic</span>, with males considerably larger than females. The head-and-body length is typically between 115&#x2013;170&#xA0;cm (45&#x2013;67&#xA0;in). Males reach approximately 88&#x2013;125&#xA0;cm (35&#x2013;49&#xA0;in) at the shoulder, while females reach 75&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm (30&#x2013;35&#xA0;in). Males typically weigh 70&#x2013;125&#xA0;kg (154&#x2013;276&#xA0;lb) and females 50&#x2013;57&#xA0;kg (110&#x2013;126&#xA0;lb). The tail is 30&#x2013;35&#xA0;cm (12&#x2013;14&#xA0;in) long.</p>
<p>As an adaptation to its swampy and marshy habitat, the sitatunga has a shaggy, water-resistant coat. The coat colour varies geographically, but, in general, is a <span>rufous</span> red in juveniles and chestnut in females. The coats of males darken with age, becoming gray to dark brown. Males develop a rough and scraggy mane, usually brown in colour, and a white dorsal stripe. There is a chevron between the eyes of the males. There are white facial markings, as well as several stripes and spots, though they are only faintly visible. White patches can be observed on the throat, near the head and the chest.</p>
<p>As a prominent sign of sexual dimorphism, only the males possess horns. The spiral horns shown one or two twists, and are 45&#x2013;90&#xA0;cm (18&#x2013;35&#xA0;in) long. Both horns are tipped with ivory. The <span>pasterns</span> are flexible. The hooves of the male are elongated and widely splayed, serving as another adaptation to the marshy environment. They can reach a length of up to 16&#xA0;cm (6.3&#xA0;in) in the hindlegs and 18&#xA0;cm (7.1&#xA0;in) in the forelegs. A pair of inguinal <span>scent glands</span> are present.</p>
