<p>The <b>grey red-backed vole</b> or the <b>grey-sided vole</b> (<i>Myodes rufocanus</i>), is a species of <span>vole</span>. An adult grey red-backed vole weighs 20-50&#xA0;grams. This species ranges across northern <span>Eurasia</span>, including northern <span>China</span>, the northern <span>Korean Peninsula</span>, and the islands of <span>Sakhalin</span> and <span>Hokkaid&#x14D;</span>. It is larger and longer-legged than the <span>northern red-backed vole</span> (<i>Myodes rutilus</i>), which covers a similar range and it is also <span>sympatric</span> with the <span>Norwegian lemming</span> (<i>Lemmus lemmus</i>).</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The grey red-backed vole has a reddish-coloured back and grey sides. It has a head and body length of 4.5 to 5.25&#xA0;in (114 to 133&#xA0;mm) and a tail length of 1 to 1.75&#xA0;in (25 to 44&#xA0;mm). It can be distinguished from the <span>bank vole</span> by its larger size and distinctive reddish back and from the northern red-backed vole by its larger size, longer legs and relatively longer tail. Unlike some other species of vole in the genus <i><span>Myodes</span></i>, the molar teeth of adults are rooted in the jaws.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The grey red-backed vole is native to northern Europe and Asia. Its range extends from Norway, Sweden and Finland eastwards through northern Russia to the <span>Kamchatka Peninsula</span>. It includes the <span>Ural Mountains</span>, the <span>Altai Mountains</span>, northern Korea, <span>Sakhalin Island</span>, Japan, northern Mongolia and China. Its altitude range extends from sea level to 1,170&#xA0;m (3,839&#xA0;ft) in Scandinavia and to 2,700&#xA0;m (8,858&#xA0;ft) in the <span>Khangai Mountains</span> in Mongolia. Its typical habitat is dense undergrowth or rocky areas in coniferous or birch forests, often near rivers, but it is also found in clear cut areas of forests, rough grassland, subarctic shrubby heathland and dry peat bogs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology">Biology</span></h2>
<p>The grey red-backed vole feeds on grasses and small herbs, the leaves and shoots of sub-shrubs and berries. It prefers the <span>bilberry</span> (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) to the <span>northern crowberry</span> (<i>Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum</i>) which contains unpalatable phenolic substances.</p>
<p>In tundra regions, this vole exhibits outbreaks when its numbers increase substantially. These occur in a four to five-year population cycle the reasons for which are not fully understood but which may reflect changes in the abundance of certain specialised predators. <span>Lemmings</span> have similar but more violent population explosions. These happen in the same years as vole outbreaks, but occur less frequently. This is partly because lemmings continue to breed during the winter months while populations of grey red-backed voles decline during the winter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The grey red-backed vole is listed by the <span>IUCN</span> as being of "<span>Least Concern</span>". This is because it is a common species with a very wide range and faces no particular threats. Populations vary cyclically but may be declining somewhat in <span>Fennoscandia</span>, possibly due to changes in forestry practice.</p>
