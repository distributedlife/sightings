<p>The <b>Eurasian curlew</b> (<i>Numenius arquata</i>) is a <span>wader</span> in the large <span>family</span> <span>Scolopacidae</span>. It is one of the most widespread of the <span>curlews</span>, breeding across temperate <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>. In Europe, this <span>species</span> is often referred to just as the <b>"curlew"</b>, and in <span>Scotland</span> known as the <b>"whaup"</b> in <span>Scots</span>.</p>

<p>This is the largest wader in its range, at 50&#x2013;60&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;24&#xA0;in) in length, with a 89&#x2013;106&#xA0;cm (35&#x2013;42&#xA0;in) wingspan and a body weight of 410&#x2013;1,360&#xA0;g (0.90&#x2013;3.00&#xA0;lb). It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back, and a very long curved bill. Males and females look identical, but the bill is longest in the adult female. It is generally not possible to recognize the sex of a single Eurasian Curlew, or even several ones as there is much variation; telling male and female of a mated pair apart is usually possible however.</p>
<p>The familiar call, from which this <span>bird</span> gets it name, is a loud <i>curloo-oo</i>.</p>
<p>The only similar species over most of the curlew's range is the <span>whimbrel</span> (<i>N. phaeopus</i>). The Whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter <span>bill</span> with a kink rather than a smooth curve. Flying curlews may also resemble, albeit not existing in the same area, <span>bar-tailed godwits</span> (<i>Limosa lapponica</i>) in their winter plumages; however, the latter have a smaller body, a slightly upturned beak, and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips. The Eurasian Curlew's feet are longer, forming a conspicuous "point".</p>
<p>The curlew exists as a <span>migratory</span> species over most of its range, wintering in <span>Africa</span>, southern <span>Europe</span> and south <span>Asia</span>. Occasionally a vagrant individual reaches places far from its normal range, such as <span>Nova Scotia</span> and the <span>Marianas</span>. It is present all year in the milder climates of the <span>United Kingdom</span> and its adjacent European coasts.</p>
<p>It is generally wary. Highly gregarious outside the breeding season, the Eurasian curlew feeds by probing soft mud for small <span>invertebrates</span>, but will also pick small <span>crabs</span> and <span>earthworms</span> off the surface if the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>The <span>nest</span> is a bare scrape on <span>taiga</span>, meadow, and similar habitats. Each curlew lays between 3 and 6 eggs in April or May and incubates them for about a month until they begin to hatch.</p>

<p>The curlew is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>Formerly classified as a species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>, it was suspected to be rarer than generally assumed. Following the evaluation of its population size, the classification was found to be incorrect, and it was consequently promoted to <span>Near Threatened</span> status in 2008. Though it is a common bird, its numbers are noticeably declining. In Ireland, for example, the breeding population is estimated to have declined by 86% in the last 30 years.</p>
