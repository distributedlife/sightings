<p>The <b>Pin-tailed Whydah</b> (<i>Vidua macroura</i>) is a small <span>songbird</span>. It is a resident breeding bird in most of <span>Africa</span> south of the <span>Sahara Desert</span>. It has also been introduced to southern <span>California</span>.</p>
<p>This <span>whydah</span> is found in many open habitats including open woodland, scrub and cultivation.</p>
<p>It is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nests of <span>estrildid finches</span>, especially waxbills. Unlike the <span>Common Cuckoo</span>, it does not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, 2-4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the firefinch are white, although the whydah's are slightly larger. The nestling whydahs mimic the <span>gape</span> pattern of the fledglings of the host species.</p>

<p>The Pin-tailed Whydah is 12&#x2013;13&#xA0;cm in length, although the breeding male's tail adds another 20&#xA0;cm to this. The adult male has a black back and crown, and a very long black tail. The wings are dark brown with white patches, and the underparts and the head, apart from the crown, are white. The bill is bright red.</p>
<p>The female and non-breeding male have streaked brown upperparts, whitish underparts with buff flanks, and a buff and black face pattern. They lack the long tail extension, but retain the red bill. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and with a greyish bill.</p>
<p>The male Pin-tailed Whydah is territorial, and one male often has several females in his small group. He has an elaborate courtship flight display, which includes hovering over the female to display his tail. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid squeaking and churring. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.</p>
