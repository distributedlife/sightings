<p>The <b>spotted nutcracker</b>, <b>Eurasian nutcracker</b>, or just <b>nutcracker</b>, (<i>Nucifraga caryocatactes</i>) is a <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> slightly larger than the <span>Eurasian jay</span>. It has a much larger bill and a slimmer looking head without any crest. The feathering over its body is predominantly a chocolate brown with distinct white spots and streaks. The wings and upper tail are virtually black with a greenish-blue gloss. It is one of three species of <span>nutcracker</span>. The <span>large-spotted nutcracker</span> (<i>Nucifraga multipunctata</i>), was formerly considered a subspecies. The other, <span>Clark's nutcracker</span> (<i>Nucifraga columbiana</i>), occurs in western <span>North America</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The nutcracker was one of the many species originally described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his 18th century work, <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i>, and it still bears its original name of <i>Nucifraga caryocatactes</i>. The scientific name is a <span>reduplication</span>, with <i>Nucifraga</i> based on <span>Latin</span>: <i>nucis</i> nut + <i>frangere</i> to shatter, and <i>caryocatactes</i> based on <span>Greek</span>: <i>karuon</i> nut + <i>kataseio</i> to shatter. The common English name <i>nutcracker</i> first appears in 1738 in a translation of a German travel guide, where it is a calque on the German name <i>Nu&#xDF;knacker</i>, as the bird was not recorded in England until 1753. Other Germanic languages have etymologically related names: <span>Danish</span>: <i>n&#xF8;ddekrige</i>; <span>Dutch</span>: <i>notenkraker</i>; <span>Norwegian</span>: <i>n&#xF8;ttekr&#xE5;ke</i>; <span>Swedish</span>: <i>n&#xF6;tkr&#xE5;ka</i>.</p>

Spotted nutcracker, (<i>Nucifraga caryocatactes</i>)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The spotted nutcracker is a dark brown, broad-winged, short-tailed corvid. Body plumage is mid to dark chocolate brown, heavily spotted with white on face, neck, mantle and underparts. It has a large white loral spot, a white eye-ring, blackish brown cap extending onto the nape, dark blackish wings with a greenish-blue gloss, all white vent, and dark tail with white corners above and a white terminal band on the undertail. In flight, broad wings, white vent and short tail are noticeable; the flight undulating. The black bill is slender and rather long, sharply pointed, and varies in size amongst races. The iris, legs and feet are black.</p>
<p>Nutcrackers range from 32&#x2013;38&#xA0;cm in length (from tip of beak to tip of tail) and have a wingspan ranging from 49&#x2013;53&#xA0;cm.</p>
<p>The voice is similar to that of the <span>Eurasian jay</span> and is loud and harsh. It is described as <i>kraak-kraak-kraak-kraak</i>.</p>

<p>The most important food resources for this species are the seeds (<span>pine nuts</span>) of various <span>Pines</span> (<i>Pinus</i> sp.), principally the cold-climate (far northern and high altitude) species of <span>white pine</span> (<i>Pinus</i> subgenus <i>Strobus</i>) with large seeds: <i><span>P. armandii</span>, <span>P. cembra</span>, <span>P. koraiensis</span>, <span>P. parviflora</span>, <span>P. peuce</span>, <span>P. pumila</span>, <span>P. sibirica</span></i> and <i><span>P. wallichiana</span></i>, and also the two lacebark pines in subgenus <i>Ducampopinus, <span>P. bungeana</span></i> and <span>P. gerardiana</span>. In some regions, where none of these pines occur, the seeds of <span>spruce</span> (<i>Picea</i> sp.) and <span>hazel</span> nuts (<i>Corylus</i> sp.) form an important part of the diet too. The forms that take hazel nuts have thicker bills for cracking their hard shells, with a special ridge on the inside of the bill edge near the base. If the shell is too hard, it holds the nut between its feet and hacks at it with its bill like a chisel.</p>
<p>Surplus seed is always stored for later use and it is this species that is responsible for the sowing of new trees of their favoured pines, including the re-establishment of the <span>Swiss pine</span> (<i>Pinus cembra</i>) over large areas in the Alps of central Europe formerly cleared by man.</p>
<p>Various <span>insects</span> are also taken, and also small <span>birds</span>, their eggs and nestlings, small <span>rodents</span> and <span>carrion</span> such as roadkills. It digs out <span>bumble bee</span> and <span>wasp</span> nests avidly to get at the grubs.</p>

Egg of spotted nutcracker</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nutcracker couples stay together for life and their territory expands between 20 and 30 acres. Nesting is always early in this species across its whole range, so as to make the best use of pine nuts stored the previous autumn. The nest is usually built high in a conifer (sometimes broadleaved trees are used) and usually on the sunny side. There are normally 2-4 eggs laid and incubated for 18 days. Both sexes feed the young which are usually fledged by about 23 days and stay with their parents for many months, following them to learn the food storage techniques essential for survival in their harsh environment.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The spotted nutcracker has an extensive range forming a broad swathe east-west from <span>Scandinavia</span> right across northern <span>Europe</span>, <span>Siberia</span> and to eastern <span>Asia</span>, including <span>Japan</span>, inhabiting the huge <span>taiga</span> <span>conifer</span> forests in the north.</p>
<p>Three further disjunct populations occur in mountain conifer forests further south, one centered on the <span>mountains</span> of central and southeast Europe (the <span>Alps</span>, the <span>Carpathians</span> and the <span>Balkan Peninsula</span> mountains); another in the western <span>Himalaya</span>; and the third in western <span>China</span> seaboard and separated from the northern population by a relatively small gap in the north centre of China. See subspecies list above for race distributions. Some of the populations can be separated on bill size.</p>
<p>This species has a large range, extending over 10,000,000&#xA0;km&#xB2; globally. It also has a large global population, with an estimate of between 800,000-1,700,000 individuals in Europe.</p>
<p>Spotted nutcrackers are not <span>migratory</span>, but will erupt out of range when a cone crop failure leaves them short of a food supply, the thin-billed eastern race <i>macrorhynchos</i> being the more likely to do this. Britain records about 8 vagrants per year, but in 1968 over 300 nutcrackers visited Britain as part of a larger irruption into western Europe, probably due to a spell of early cold weather in Siberia.</p>
