<p>The <b>Black-winged Red Bishop</b> (<i>Euplectes hordeaceus</i>), formerly known in southern Africa as the <b>Fire-crowned Bishop</b>, is a resident breeding <span>bird</span> species in tropical <span>Africa</span> from <span>Senegal</span> to <span>Sudan</span> and south to <span>Angola</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span> and <span>Mozambique</span>.</p>
<p>This common <span>weaver</span> occurs in a range of open country, especially tall grassland and often near water. It builds a spherical woven nest in tall grass. 2-4 eggs are laid.</p>
<p>The Black-winged Red Bishop is a stocky 13&#x2013;15&#xA0;cm bird. The breeding male is scarlet apart from his black face, belly and wings and brown tail. The conical bill is thick and black. He displays prominently, singing high-pitched twitters from tall grass, puffing out his feathers or performing a slow hovering display flight.</p>
<p>The non-breeding male is yellow-brown, streaked above and shading to whitish below. It has a whitish supercilium. It resembles non-breeding male <span>Northern Red Bishop</span>, but is darker and has black wings. Females are similar, but paler. Young birds have wider pale fringes on their flight feathers.</p>
<p>The Black-winged Red Bishop is a gregarious species which feeds on seed, grain and some insects.</p>
