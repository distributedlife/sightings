<p>The <b>Daurian jackdaw</b> (<i>Corvus dauuricus</i>) is a <span>bird</span> in the <span>Corvidae</span>, or <span>crow</span> <span>family</span>. It is closely related to the <span>western jackdaw</span>. The name derives from the <span>Dauria</span> region of eastern Russia.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is about the same size as or slightly smaller (32&#xA0;cm in length) than the western jackdaw, with the same proportions and identical habits. The principal difference lies in the <span>plumage</span>; many but not all adults have large areas of creamy white on the lower parts extending up around the neck as a broad collar. The head, throat, wings, and tail are glossy black and the ear coverts are grizzled grey. Darker adults and young birds resemble western jackdaws, though Daurian jackdaws have black <span>irises</span>, unlike the distinctive grey-white irises of the Eurasian jackdaw. The only other pied corvid species inhabiting the same region is the Chinese <span>collared crow</span> (<i>Corvus torquatus</i>) but as this is a much larger bird (about the same size or slightly larger than the <span>carrion crow</span>) confusion is unlikely to occur.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Daurian jackdaw ranges from the southern part of eastern <span>Siberia</span>, south to <span>Mongolia</span> and throughout much of <span>China</span>. In the north of its range it <span>migrates</span> further south during the winter. It is a scarce winter visitor to <span>Korea</span>, a rare annual winter visitor to <span>Japan</span>, and a vagrant to <span>Taiwan</span>. There are a few records from <span>Western Europe</span>. It inhabits open woodland, river valleys, and open hills and mountains.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It is a sociable species often found in association with <span>rooks</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The food is similar to that of the <span>western jackdaw</span> and includes cultivated grains, insects, berries, eggs, carrion, and faeces.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The species will nest in trees where suitable cavities cannot be found, though <span>tree hollows</span>, rock openings and ruined buildings are still favoured. The eggs are similar to those of the western jackdaw.</p>
