<p>The <b>white-throated needletail</b> (<i>Hirundapus caudacutus</i>), also known as <b>needle-tailed swift</b> or <b>spine-tailed swift</b>, is a large <span>swift</span>. It is the fastest-flying bird in flapping <span>flight</span>, with confirmed speeds reaching 111.6&#xA0;km/h (69.3&#xA0;mph). It is commonly reputed to reach velocities of up to 170&#xA0;km/h (105&#xA0;mph), though this has not been verified.</p>
<p>These birds have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. They build their nests in rock crevices in cliffs or hollow trees. They never settle voluntarily on the ground and spend most of their lives in the air, living on the <span>insects</span> they catch in their beaks.</p>
<p>These swifts breed in rocky hills in central <span>Asia</span> and southern <span>Siberia</span>. This species is <span>migratory</span>, wintering south in the <span>Indian Subcontinent</span>, <span>Southeast Asia</span> and <span>Australia</span>. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, but has been recorded as far west as <span>Norway</span>, <span>Sweden</span> and <span>Great Britain</span>. In June 2013, the bird was spotted in the United Kingdom, the first sighting in 22 years. This bird flew into a <span>wind turbine</span> and died; its body was sent to a museum.</p>
<p>The white-throated needletail is a mid-sized <span>bird</span>, similar in size to an <span>Alpine swift</span>, but a different build, with a heavier barrel-like body. They are black except for a white throat and white under-tail, which extends on to the flanks, and a somewhat paler brown back.</p>
<p>The <i><span>Hirundapus</span></i> needletailed swifts get their name from the spiny end to the tail, which is not forked as in the <i><span>Apus</span></i> typical swifts.</p>
