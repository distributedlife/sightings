<p>The <b>stone curlew</b>, <b>Eurasian thick-knee</b>, or <b>Eurasian stone-curlew</b> (<i>Burhinus oedicnemus</i>) is a northern species of the <span>Burhinidae</span> (<span>stone-curlew</span>) <span>bird</span> family.</p>
<p>It is a fairly large wader though is mid-sized by the standards of its <span>family</span>. Length ranges from 38 to 46&#xA0;cm (15 to 18&#xA0;in), wingspan from 76 to 88&#xA0;cm (30 to 35&#xA0;in) and weight from 290 to 535&#xA0;g (10.2 to 18.9&#xA0;oz). with a strong yellow and black beak, large yellow eyes (which give it a "<span>reptilian</span>", or "goggle-eyed" appearance), and cryptic plumage. The bird is striking in flight, with black and white wing markings.</p>
<p>Despite being classed as a wader, this species prefers dry open habitats with some bare ground. It is largely <span>nocturnal</span>, particularly when singing its loud wailing songs, which are reminiscent of that of <span>curlews</span>. Food consists of <span>insects</span> and other small <span>invertebrates</span>, and occasionally small <span>reptiles</span>, <span>frogs</span> and <span>rodents</span>. It lays 2-3 eggs in a narrow scrape in the ground.</p>
<p>The stone curlew occurs throughout <span>Europe</span>, north <span>Africa</span> and southwestern <span>Asia</span>. It is a summer <span>migrant</span> in the more temperate European and Asian parts of its range, wintering in <span>Africa</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The <span>genus</span> name <i>Burhinus</i> comes from the <span>Greek</span> <i>bous</i>, ox, and <i>rhis</i>, nose. The <span>species</span> name <i>oedicnemus</i> comes from the Greek <i>oidio</i>, to swell, and <i>kneme</i>, the shin or leg, referring to the bird's prominent <span>tibiotarsal joints</span> which also give it the common name of "thick-knee". This is an abbreviated form of <span>Pennant's</span> 1776 coinage "thick kneed <span>bustard</span>".</p>
<p>The name "stone curlew" was first recorded by <span>Francis Willughby</span> in 1667 as a <i>"third sort of <span>Godwit</span>, which in <span>Cornwall</span> they call the Stone-Curlew, differing from the precedent in that it hath a much shorter and slenderer Bill than either of them"</i>. It derives from the bird's nocturnal calls sounding like the unrelated <span>Eurasian Curlew</span> <i>Numenius arquata</i> and its preference for barren stoney <span>heaths</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h2>
<p>There are five <span>subspecies</span> of <i>Burhinus oedicnemus</i>: The <span>Indian stone-curlew</span> was previously considered a subspecies.</p>
