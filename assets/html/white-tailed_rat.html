<p>The <b>white-tailed rat</b>, <i><b>Mystromys albicaudatus</b></i>, also known as the <b>white-tailed mouse</b>, is the only member of the subfamily <b>Mystromyinae</b> in the family <span>Nesomyidae</span>. This species is sometimes placed in the subfamily <span>Cricetinae</span> due to similarities in appearance between the white-tailed rat and <span>hamsters</span>, but <span>molecular phylogenetic</span> studies have confirmed that the two groups are not closely related. The <span>subfamily</span> Mystromyinae is sometimes placed within the family <span>Muridae</span> along with all other subfamilies of <span>muroids</span>.</p>
<p>The white-tailed rat is restricted to <span>savannas</span> and grasslands of <span>South Africa</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>. They tend to inhabit burrows of <span>meerkats</span> and cracks in the soil during the day and venture out at night. They eat vegetable matter such as seeds and have been known to take insects. Unlike <span>hamsters</span>, white-tailed rats do not have <span>cheek pouches</span>.</p>
