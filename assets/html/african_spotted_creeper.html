<p>The <b>African spotted creeper</b> (<i>Salpornis salvadori</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>, which is a member of the subfamily <span>Salpornithinae</span> of the <span>treecreeper</span> family Certhiidae. It is found in sub-Saharan <span>Africa</span> in open deciduous forest and mango groves. It does not <span>migrate</span> other than local movements.</p>
<p>The African spotted creeper has strongly spotted and barred plumage, clearly different from the treecreepers of the subfamily <span>Certhiinae</span>. It weighs up to 16&#xA0;grams, twice as much as treecreepers of similar length (up to 15&#xA0;cm).</p>
<p>The African spotted creeper has a thin pointed down-curved bill, which it uses to extricate insects from bark, but it lacks the stiff tail feathers which the true treecreepers use to support themselves on vertical trees.</p>
<p>Its nests and eggs are quite different from those of the Certhiinae. The nest is a cup placed on a horizontal branch, usually in a crotch, and camouflaged with spiders' egg sacs, caterpillar <span>frass</span>, and <span>lichen</span>. The clutch is usually of three eggs, which are blue or greenish, marked with grey, lavender, and brown.</p>
<p>This species and the <span>Indian spotted creeper</span> were formerly considered conspecific. Together they were called spotted creeper. Four subspecies are recognized within their distribution. The nominate <i>salvadori</i> described by Bocage in 1878 is found in eastern Uganda, western Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique. Subspecies <i>emini</i> described by Hartlaub in 1884 is found northwards from west Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, to Cameroon and Chad in the east. Subspecies <i>erlangeri</i> described by Neumann in 1907 is restricted to the Ethiopian highlands. Subspecies <i>xylodromus</i> described by Clancey in 1975 is found in the Zambezi Escarpment, Mashonaland Plateau and adjoining Mozambique.</p>
<p>In addition to the treecreeper family, there are two other small bird families with 'treecreeper' or 'creeper' in their name &#x2013; the <span>Australian treecreepers</span> and the <span>Philippine creepers</span>.</p>
