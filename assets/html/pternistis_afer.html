<p>The <b>red-necked spurfowl</b> or <b>red-necked francolin</b> (<i>Pternistis afer</i>), is a <span>gamebird</span> in the pheasant family <span>Phasianidae</span> of the order <span>Galliformes</span>, gallinaceous birds.</p>
<p>The red-necked spurfowl breeds across the central belt of <span>Africa</span> and down the east coast to <span>Tanzania</span>.</p>
<p>It is 25&#x2013;38&#xA0;cm in length, with a significant size difference between the subspecies, of which there are seven. It is a generally dark <span>francolin</span>, brown above and black-streaked grey or white underparts. The bill, bare facial skin, neck and legs are bright red.</p>
<p>The red-necked spurfowl is a wary species, keeping to deep cover, although it sometimes feeds in open scrub or cultivation if disturbance is limited and there are thickets nearby. The nest is a bare scrape, and three to nine eggs are laid.</p>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large range, the red-necked spurfowl is evaluated as Least Concern on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species.</p>
