<p>The <b>Siberian flying squirrel</b> (<i>Pteromys volans</i>) is an <span>Old World flying squirrel</span> with a range from the <span>Baltic Sea</span> in the west to the <span>Pacific</span> coast in the east. It is the only species of flying squirrel found in <span>Europe</span>. It is considered <span>vulnerable</span> within the <span>European Union</span> where it is found only in <span>Finland</span>, <span>Estonia</span> and <span>Latvia</span>.</p>
<p>A female Siberian flying squirrel weighs about 150 <span>grams</span>, the males being slightly smaller on average. The body is 13&#x2013;20 cm long, with a 9&#x2013;14 cm long flattened tail. The eyes are large and strikingly black. The coat is gray all over, the abdomen being slightly lighter than the back, with a black stripe between the neck and the forelimb. A distinctive feature of flying squirrels is the furry glide membrane or <span>patagium</span>, a flap of skin that stretches between the front and rear legs. By spreading this membrane the flying squirrel may glide from tree to tree across distances of over a hundred metres, and have been known to record a <span>glide ratio</span> of 3.31, but is normally 1-1.5.</p>
<p>Its diet consists of <span>leaves</span>, <span>seeds</span>, <span>cones</span>, <span>buds</span>, <span>sprouts</span>, <span>nuts</span>, <span>berries</span> and occasionally bird <span>eggs</span> and nestlings. When <span>alder</span> and <span>birch</span> <span>catkins</span> are plentiful, the squirrel may store them for the winter in old <span>woodpecker</span> holes or similar nooks.</p>
<p>The squirrels are preyed upon by <span>martens</span>, <span>owls</span>, and cats.</p>
<p>They mate early in the spring. In southern <span>Finland</span> the first mating season begins in late March, with a second mating season occurring in April. After a gestation period of five weeks, the female gives birth to a litter of usually two or three young, each weighing about 5 grams. They preferentially build their nest in holes made by woodpeckers, but they may also nest in <span>birdhouses</span> if the size of the entrance is appropriate. The nest consists of a pile of soft materials (preferably soft <span>beard lichen</span>) into which the squirrel burrows. They can live up to about five years.</p>
<p>They favour old forests with a mix of <span>conifers</span> and <span>deciduous trees</span>. They are mostly <span>nocturnal</span>, being most active late in the evening, although females with young may also feed during the day. They do not <span>hibernate</span>, but in the winter they may sometimes sleep continuously for several days. As shy and nocturnal animals, they are seldom seen. The most common sign of their presence is their droppings, which resemble orange-yellow rice grains and are often found beneath or on top of their nest.</p>
<p>It is the emblem of the <span>Nuuksio National Park</span> in <span>Espoo</span> municipality of <span>Finland</span> due to the density of the population in this region.</p>
