<p>This is a small cormorant at 50&#x2013;55&#xA0;cm length and an 85&#xA0;cm wingspan. It is mainly black, glossed green, in the breeding season. The wing coverts are silvery. It has a longish tail, a short head crest and a red or yellow face patch. The bill is yellow.</p>
<p>Sexes are similar, but non-breeding adults and juveniles are browner, with a white belly. Some southern races retain the crest all year round.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The reed cormorant can dive to considerable depths, but usually feeds in shallow water. It frequently brings prey to the surface. It takes a wide variety of <span>fish</span>. It prefers small slow-moving fish, and those with long and tapering shapes, such as <span>mormyrids</span>, <span>catfishes</span>, and <span>cichlids</span>. It will less frequently eat <span>soles</span> (which can be important in its diet locally), frogs, aquatic invertebrates, and small birds.</p>
<p>Two to four <span>eggs</span> are laid in a nest in a tree or on the ground, normally hidden from view by long grass.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>This is a common and widespread species, and is not considered to be threatened. It breeds on freshwater wetlands or quiet coasts.</p>
