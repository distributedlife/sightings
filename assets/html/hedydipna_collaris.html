<p>The <b>Collared Sunbird</b>, (<i>Hedydipna collaris</i>), is a <span>sunbird</span>. The sunbirds are a group of very small <span>Old World</span> <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> which feed largely on <span>nectar</span>, although they will also take <span>insects</span>, especially when feeding young. Collared Sunbird is in fact mainly <span>insectivorous</span>.</p>

<p>Sunbird flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a <span>hummingbird</span>, but usually perch to feed most of the time.</p>
<p>Collared Sunbird is a common breeder across most of sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>. Two or three <span>eggs</span> are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. It is a seasonal <span>migrant</span> within its range.</p>
<p>Collared Sunbirds are tiny, only 9&#x2013;10&#xA0;cm long. They have short thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to nectar feeding.</p>
<p>The adult male has glossy green upperparts and head with a yellow belly and narrow purple breast band. The female is a duller green above and entirely yellow below.</p>
<p>This species is found in forests near water.</p>
