<p>The <b>spur-winged lapwing</b> or <b>spur-winged plover</b> (<i>Vanellus spinosus</i>) is a <span>lapwing</span> <span>species</span>, one of a group of largish <span>waders</span> in the family <span>Charadriidae</span>.</p>
<p>It breeds around the eastern <span>Mediterranean</span>, and in a wide band from sub-<span>Saharan</span> west <span>Africa</span> to <span>Arabia</span>. The <span>Greek</span> and <span>Turkish</span> breeders are <span>migratory</span>, but other populations are resident.</p>
<p>These are conspicuous and unmistakable <span>birds</span>. They are medium-large waders with black crown, chest, foreneck stripe and tail. The face, the rest of the neck and belly are white and the wings and back are light brown. The bill and legs are black. Its striking appearance is supplemented by its noisy nature, with a loud <i>did-he-do-it</i> call.</p>
<p>The bird got its name because of a spur (a small <span>claw</span>) hidden in each of its wings.</p>
<p>This species has a preference for marshes and similar freshwater wetland habitats. The food of the spur-winged lapwing is <span>insects</span> and other invertebrates, which are picked from the ground. The famed "<span>crocodile bird</span>" is sometimes taken to be this species, but it is actually the true <span>plover</span> <i><span>Pluvianus aegyptius</span></i>.</p>
<p>It lays two blotchy yellowish eggs on a ground scrape. The spur-winged lapwing is known to sometimes use the wing-claws in an attack on animals and, rarely, people, who get too close to the birds' exposed offspring.</p>
<p>This species is declining in its northern range, but is abundant in much of tropical Africa, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range. The spur-winged lapwing is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name_confusion">Name confusion</span></h2>
<p>Note that the well-known "spur-winged plover" of southern <span>Australasia</span> is a different species <i>Vanellus miles</i>. To avoid confusion, it has been renamed <span>masked lapwing</span>.</p>
<p>A similar-looking <span>species</span> from <span>Southeast Asia</span> was called "spur-winged lapwing" while <i>V. spinosus</i> was still referred to as ""<span>plover</span>". This is now the <span>river lapwing</span> (<i>Vanellus duvaucelii</i>).</p>
