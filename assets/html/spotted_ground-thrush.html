<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Its natural <span>habitats</span> are subtropical or tropical dry <span>forests</span>, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist <span>montane forests</span>, and subtropical or tropical moist <span>shrubland</span>. It is threatened by <span>habitat loss</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology_and_behaviour">Biology and behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The spotted ground thrush spends much of its time in leaf-litter on the forest floor where it flicks through the leaves in search of small <span>invertebrates</span>, and despite its distinctive colouration, it is often difficult to see.</p>
<p>In <span>KwaZulu-Natal</span>, South Africa, the birds have distinctive winter and summer ranges. In winter these birds spend their time in remnant coastal forests, and in summer they move to forests further inland.</p>
<p>The birds lay bluish-coloured eggs in a cup-shaped nest.</p>
