<p>The <b>African finfoot</b> (<i>Podica senegalensis</i>) is an <span>aquatic bird</span> inhabiting the rivers and lakes of western, central, and southern <span>Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The African finfoot is an underwater specialist with a long neck, a striking sharp <span>beak</span>, and bright red, lobed feet. The <span>plumage</span> varies by race, generally pale underneath and darker on top. The males are usually darker than the females. It superficially resembles <span>South America</span>'s <span>torrent duck</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habits_and_Range">Habits and Range</span></h2>
<p>The African finfoot can be found in a range of <span>habitats</span> across Africa, where there are rivers, streams and lakes with good cover on the banks. This range includes <span>forest</span>, wooded <span>savannah</span>, flooded forest, and even <span>mangrove</span> swamps.</p>
<p>The finfoot feeds on aquatic invertebrates, including both adults and larval mayflies, dragonflies, crustaceans, also snails, fish and amphibians. They are thought to be highly opportunistic and take some of their prey directly off the waters surface. They are adept out of water and will forage on the banks as well, unlike the grebes, which they resemble but are not related to.</p>
<p>Finfoots are usually seen singly or in pairs. They are very secretive. Even experienced ornithologists see them very rarely, making them a prized sighting for birders and twitchers. Because they are so elusive, it is not known if they spend most of their time in the water, where they are almost always seen, or on land.</p>
<p>Their time of breeding varies by area, usually coinciding with the <span>rainy season</span>. They build a nest, nothing more than a mess of twigs and reeds, on a fallen tree above the water. Two <span>eggs</span> are laid and <span>incubated</span> solely by the female. The chicks leave the nest a few days after hatching.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationships">Relationships</span></h2>
<p>The African finfoot belongs to a family whose only other members are the <span>masked finfoot</span> and the <span>sungrebe</span>. Their relationships to other birds are poorly understood.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_Conservation">Status and Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The African finfoot's <span>conservation</span> status is hard to determine, given its elusive nature. It is not considered threatened, as it is not persecuted or targeted by <span>hunters</span>, and while scarce, it is very widespread. However, there is concern that it may become threatened, as <span>wetlands</span> are cleared and watercourses altered and <span>polluted</span>. It is also thought to tolerate only minimal disturbance. This and increased habitat fragmentation mean that the species needs to be monitored to safeguard it. There are currently no African finfoots in captivity.</p>
