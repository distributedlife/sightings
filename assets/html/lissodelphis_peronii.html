<p>The <b>southern right whale dolphin</b> (<i>Lissodelphis peronii</i>) is a small and slender species of mammal found in cool waters of the southern hemisphere. The dolphin is one of two species of <span>right whale dolphin</span>, <i>Lissodelphis</i>, the other being found in deep oceans of the northern hemisphere.</p>

Southern right whale dolphins porpoising</div>

<p>Southern right whale dolphins are the only dolphins without dorsal fins in the southern hemisphere. They are smaller than northern right whale dolphins and have more white on their head and sides. They have slim, graceful bodies which are black on the upper side and white underneath. Their flippers are mainly white and are small and curved. Their flukes are small with a notch in the middle and concave trailing edges. Their beaks are small but distinct. They have between 43 to 49 teeth in each row of both jaws.</p>
<p>The distribution range of the species is subtropical to subantarctic oceans of the southern hemisphere. The range and total population have not been estimated or closely studied. Large populations are recorded off the western coasts of South America, where they are targeted by whaling operations; it is described as abundant in this region and off the coast of New Zealand. The range is associated with cold currents up the western and southern coasts of Africa, with a concentration recorded near Namibia. The species is recorded with other cetaceans such as <i>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</i>, the <span>dusky dolphin</span>, and the pilot whale <i><span>Globicephala macrorhynchus</span></i>. The southern right whale dolphin travels in groups of up to 1000 individuals, 52 being the average group size. The mass stranding of <i>L. peronii</i> on beaches, as many as 77, has been recorded.</p>
<p>The species was first published by <span>Bernard Germain de Lac&#xE9;p&#xE8;de</span> in 1804. The genus <i>Lissodelphis</i>, is placed within <span>Delphinidae</span>, the oceanic dolphin family of <span>cetaceans</span>. The name of the genus was derived from Greek <i>lisso</i>, smooth, and <i>delphis</i>. The specific epithet <i>peronii</i> commemorates <span>Fran&#xE7;ois P&#xE9;ron</span>, who saw the species near <span>Tasmania</span> during an expedition in 1800. The <span>common names</span> for the species include southern right-whale dolphin and snake porpoise. Both species in the genus are also referred by the name "right whale dolphin", a name derived from the <span>right whales</span> (<i>Eubalaena</i>) which also lack a dorsal fin.</p>
<p>This delphinid was not targeted by whaling operations of the nineteenth century, although it was sometimes caught for meat. The species is harvested by small fisheries in Peru, other threats include drowning and accidental capture in fishing operations elsewhere. Large numbers of <i>L. peronii</i> are sometimes taken by <span>gillnetting</span> and <span>longline fishing</span> in oceans off the southern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>Southern right whale dolphins are presumably eaten by sharks and <i><span>Orcinus orca</span></i>. <i>L. peronii</i> itself preys on an undetermined range of fish, but is known to eat crustaceans, squid and species of <span>myctophids</span>. Their diet could possibly include <span>euphausiids</span> (krill). Little is known of their particular habits, and it is not known whether they search for their food near the surface or at greater depths.</p>

<p>They have a streamlined body, a short, defined beak, no visible teeth, a single blowhole. They are black and white in colour, white underside. No dorsal fin. Fast active swimmer. Newborn calves are about 80&#x2013;100&#xA0;cm (31&#x2013;39&#xA0;in) in length. Adults are between 1.8&#x2013;2.9&#xA0;m (5&#xA0;ft 11&#xA0;in&#x2013;9&#xA0;ft 6&#xA0;in). Females tend to be slightly longer than males. Adults weigh between 60&#x2013;100&#xA0;kg (130&#x2013;220&#xA0;lb). They eat fish, squid, and octopus.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h3>
<p>Southern right whale dolphins are very graceful and often move by leaping out of the water continuously. When they swim slowly, they expose only a small area of the head and back when they surface to breathe. Breaching, belly-flopping, side-slapping and lob-tailing (slapping the flukes on the water surface) have been witnessed. They typically live in groups of between 2 and 100. Some groups are more nervous than others and will swim away from boats, whereas others will approach and possibly bow-ride. This tendency to bow-ride worked against them in the 19th century, as it allowed whalers to harpoon them from the bow and use them as food. Southern right whale dolphins are often seen in the company of <span>hourglass dolphins</span>.</p>

<p>The southern right whale dolphin is included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (<span>Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU</span>) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (<span>Pacific Cetaceans MoU</span>).</p>
