<p>The <b>Japanese bush warbler</b> (<i>Horornis diphone</i>), is an Asian <span>passerine</span> bird more often heard than seen. Its distinctive breeding <span>call</span> can be heard throughout much of <span>Japan</span> from the start of <span>spring</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The bird is drab-coloured and secretive. It is normally only seen in spring before there is foliage in the trees. In winter the call is a low chirping. The Japanese bush warbler tends to remain deep in the shadow of foliage during the day.</p>
<p>The Japanese bush warbler is olive brown above and tending toward dusky colors below. It has pale eyebrows. It has a beak that curves up making it look like it is smiling. The bird is typically 15.5 centimetres (6.1&#xA0;in) in length.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The Japanese bush warbler is a common year-round resident throughout Japan (except Hokkaid&#x14D;) and northern Philippines. In summer the Japanese bush warbler can also be found in <span>Hokkaid&#x14D;</span>, <span>Manchuria</span>, Korea, and central China. In winter, the bush-warbler can also be found in southern China and <span>Taiwan</span>.</p>
<p>In summer it ranges from low hills to high mountains, preferring <span>bamboo</span> thickets and black pine trees. In winter it seeks cover at lower elevations.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_to_humans">Relationship to humans</span></h2>
<p>The propensity of the Japanese bush warbler to sing has led to the birds being kept as cage birds. Robert Young records that to encourage singing the cages of kept birds were covered with a wooden box with a small paper window that allowed only subdued light in. Along with the return of the <span>barn swallow</span> the bush warbler's call is viewed by Japanese as a herald of springtime.</p>
<p>It is one of the favorite motifs of <span>Japanese poetry</span>, featured in many poems including those in <i><span>Man'y&#x14D;sh&#x16B;</span></i> or <i><span>Kokin Wakash&#x16B;</span></i>. In <span>haiku</span> and <span>renga</span>, <i>uguisu</i> is one of the <span>kigo</span> which signify the early spring. In poetry the bird is associated with the <span>ume</span> blossom, and appears with ume on <span>hanafuda</span> playing cards. There is also a popular Japanese sweet named <i>Uguisu-boru</i> (Uguisu Balls) which consists of brown and white balls meant to resemble ume flower buds. However, the distinctive song is not usually heard until later in spring, well after the ume blossoms have faded. In haiku the bird with this song is known as <i>sasako</i>, and the song is called <i>sasanaki</i>.</p>
<p>The beauty of its song led to the English name <i>Japanese Nightingale</i>, although the Japanese bush warbler does not sing at night as the European nightingale does. This name is no longer commonly used.</p>
<p>An <i>uguisu-j&#x14D;</i> (j&#x14D; = woman) is a female announcer at Japanese baseball games, or a woman employed to advertise products and sales with a microphone outside retail stores. These women are employed because of their beautiful 'warbling' voices. They are also employed to make public announcements for politicians in the lead-up to elections.</p>
<p>In Japanese architecture there is a type of floor known as "<span>uguisubari</span>", which is generally translated into English as "<span>nightingale floor</span>". These floors have squeaking floorboards that resemble the Japanese bush warbler's low chirping, and are meant to be so designed to warn sleepers of the approach of <span>ninja</span>. <span>Examples</span> can be seen at <span>Eikan-d&#x14D; temple</span>, <span>Nij&#x14D; Castle</span> and <span>Chion-in</span> temple in Kyoto.</p>
<p>The <span>nightingale's droppings</span> contain an enzyme that has been used for a long time as a <span>skin whitening</span> agent and to remove fine wrinkles. It is sometimes sold as "uguisu powder". The droppings are also used to remove stains from <span>kimono</span>.</p>
