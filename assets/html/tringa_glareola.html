<p>The <b>wood sandpiper</b> (<i>Tringa glareola</i>) is a small <span>wader</span>. This <span>Eurasian</span> <span>species</span> is the smallest of the <span>shanks</span>, which are mid-sized long-legged waders of the <span>family</span> <span>Scolopacidae</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p>It resembles a longer-legged and more delicate <span>green</span> (<i>T. ochropus</i>) or <span>solitary sandpiper</span> (<i>T. solitaria</i>) with a short fine <span>bill</span>, brown back and longer yellowish legs. It differs from the first of those species in a smaller and less contrasting white rump patch, while the solitary sandpiper has no white rump patch at all.</p>
<p>However, it is not very closely related to these two species. Rather, its closest relative is the <span>common redshank</span> (<i>T. totanus</i>), and these two share a <span>sister relationship</span> with the <span>marsh sandpiper</span> (<i>T. stagnatilis</i>). These three species are a group of smallish shanks with red or yellowish legs, a breeding <span>plumage</span> that is generally subdued light brown above with some darker mottling and with a pattern of somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck.</p>

<p>The wood sandpiper breeds in <span>subarctic</span> <span>wetlands</span> from the <span>Scottish</span> <span>Highlands</span> across <span>Europe</span> and <span>Asia</span>. They <span>migrate</span> to <span>Africa</span>, Southern <span>Asia</span>, particularly <span>India</span>, and Australia. <span>Vagrant</span> birds have been seen as far into the <span>Pacific</span> as the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span>. In <span>Micronesia</span> it is a regular visitor to the <span>Marianas Islands</span> (where flocks of up to 32 birds are reported) and <span>Palau</span>; it is recorded on <span>Kwajalein</span> in the <span>Marshall Islands</span> about once per decade. This species is encountered in the western Pacific region between mid-October and mid-May. A slight westward expansion saw the establishment of a small but permanent breeding population in Scotland since the 1950s.</p>
<p>This bird is usually found on <span>freshwater</span> during migration and wintering. They forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud, and mainly eat <span>insects</span> and similar small prey. <i>T. glareola</i> nests on the ground or uses an abandoned old tree nest of another <span>bird</span>, such as the <span>fieldfare</span> (<i>Turdus pilaris</i>). Four pale green eggs are laid between March and May.</p>
<p>The wood sandpiper is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>
<p>Widespread, it is considered a Species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
