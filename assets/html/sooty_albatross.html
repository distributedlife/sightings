<p>The <b>sooty albatross</b>, <b>dark-mantled sooty albatross</b> or <b>dark-mantled albatross</b>, <i>Phoebetria fusca</i>, is a species of bird in the <span>albatross</span> <span>family</span>. They breed on sub-Antarctic islands and range at sea across the Southern Ocean from South America to Australia.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Sooty albatrosses are a type of albatross that belong to <span>Diomedeidae</span> family and come from the <span>Procellariiformes</span> order, along with <span>shearwaters</span>, <span>fulmars</span>, <span>storm petrels</span>, and <span>diving petrels</span>. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The sooty albatross is a medium sized albatross and measures about 85&#xA0;cm (33&#xA0;in), with a 2&#xA0;m (6.6&#xA0;ft) wingspan. Adult body mass ranges from 2.1 to 3.4&#xA0;kg (4.6 to 7.5&#xA0;lb). It is sooty-brown with darker shading on the sides of its head. It has a white crescent above and behind its eye. Its <span>bill</span> is black with an orange or yellow <span>sulcus</span>. The tail of this albatross is wide diamond shaped. Juveniles are similar to adults, although they can have paler feathers on the nape and upper back, possibly creating confusion with <span>light-mantled albatross</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior">Behavior</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Their diet consists of <span>squid</span>, <span>crustaceans</span>, <span>cephalopods</span>, fish, and carrion.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</span></h3>
<p>The sooty albatross is a colonial bird; however not to the degree of other <span>albatrosses</span>, as their colonies usually consist of 50 to 60 pair. They will build their nests on cliffs and steep slopes. Whereas they can mate annually they only do so biennially.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range_and_habitat">Range and habitat</span></h2>
<p>This albatross nests on islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean (<span>Gough Island</span> and the <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> group) and Indian Ocean (<span>Prince Edward Island</span>, <span>Marion Island</span>, the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Amsterdam Island</span>, and <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>). They forage in both oceans north to about 30&#xB0;S.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The <span>IUCN</span> ranks the sooty albatross as <span>endangered</span> with an occurrence range of 40,800,000&#xA0;km (15,800,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi) and a breeding range of 1,900&#xA0;km (730&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). A 1998 estimate place the population at 42,000 adult birds.</p>
<p>Populations have been shrinking 75% over the last 90 years; although the rate of reduction has recently slowed. The 21st century has seen stable populations at <span>Gough Island</span>.</p>
<p>This species is not overly affected by <span>longline fisheries</span>, but instead by domestic cats eating eggs and chicks on <span>Amsterdam Island</span> and the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span>. <span>Avian cholera</span>, <span>pasteurellosis</span>, and <span>erysipelas</span> are major threats. Illegal poaching has nearly ceased.</p>
<p>Studies and surveys are conducted to assist in slowing its demise. It is a protected species on the <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> group, <span>Gough Island</span> is a <span>World Heritage Site</span>, and <span>Prince Edward Island</span>, <span>Gough Island</span>, and <span>Inaccessible Island</span> in the <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> group are protected nature preserves. Also, in 2007, the <span>Crozet Islands</span>, <span>Amsterdam Island</span>, and the <span>Kerguelen Islands</span> were declared nature preserves.</p>
