<p><b>Caspian gull</b> is a <span>name</span> applied to the <span>gull</span> <span>taxon</span> <i>Larus (argentatus) cachinnans</i>, a member of the <span>herring gull</span>/<span>lesser black-backed gull</span> complex.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a large gull at 56&#x2013;68&#xA0;cm (22&#x2013;27&#xA0;in) long, with a 137 to 155&#xA0;cm (54 to 61&#xA0;in) wingspan and a body mass of 680&#x2013;1,590&#xA0;g (1.50&#x2013;3.51&#xA0;lb). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 38.5 to 48&#xA0;cm (15.2 to 18.9&#xA0;in), the <span>bill</span> is 4.6 to 6.4&#xA0;cm (1.8 to 2.5&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 5.8 to 7.7&#xA0;cm (2.3 to 3.0&#xA0;in). The Caspian gull has a long, slender bill, accentuated by the sloping forehead. The legs, wings and neck are longer than those of the herring gull and <span>yellow-legged gull</span>. The eye is small and often dark, the legs vary from pale pink to a pale yellowish colour. The back and wings are a slightly darker shade of grey than the herring gull but slightly paler than the yellow-legged gull. The outermost <span>primary feather</span> has a large white tip and a white tongue running up the inner web.</p>
<p>First-winter birds have a pale head with dark streaking on the back of the neck. The underparts are pale and the back is greyish. The greater and median <span>wing-coverts</span> have whitish tips forming two pale lines across the wing.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The Caspian gull breeds around the <span>Black</span> and <span>Caspian Seas</span>, extending eastwards across <span>Central Asia</span> to north-west <span>China</span>. In <span>Europe</span> it has been spreading north and west and now breeds in <span>Poland</span> and eastern <span>Germany</span>. Some birds migrate south as far as the <span>Red Sea</span> and <span>Persian Gulf</span> while others disperse into <span>Western Europe</span>, in countries such as <span>Sweden</span>, Norway and Denmark. Small numbers are now seen regularly in <span>Britain</span>, especially in <span>South-east England</span>, <span>East Anglia</span> and the <span>Midlands</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h2>
<p>It typically nests on flat, low-lying ground by water unlike the yellow-legged gull which mainly nests on cliffs in areas where the two overlap. The breeding season starts from early April. Two or three eggs are laid and incubated for 27 to 31 days.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h2>
<p>They are <span>scavengers</span> and <span>predators</span> with a very varied diet. During the breeding season they often eat <span>rodents</span> such as <span>ground squirrels</span>, flying some distance into the steppes to find them.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification_and_subspecies">Classification and subspecies</span></h2>
<p>This form has a troubled taxonomic history, summarised in the <span>herring gull</span> article. The Caspian gull used to be treated as a subspecies of the herring gull but it is now treated as a full species by many authorities (e.g. the <span>British Ornithologists' Union</span> Records Committee). Some authorities include the yellow-legged gull (<i>L. michahellis</i>) within <i>L. cachinnans</i> but it is now commonly considered to be a separate species.</p>
<p>The <b>steppe gull</b> or <b>Baraba gull</b> (<i>L. (cachinnans) barabensis</i>) may be regarded as a subspecies of the Caspian gull or as a separate species. It is also very similar genetically to its northern neighbour, the <i>taimyrensis</i> race of <span>Heuglin's gull</span>. The steppe gull breeds in Central Asia, particularly northern <span>Kazakhstan</span>. Its non-breeding range is still little-known but most are thought to winter in south-west <span>Asia</span> from the Persian Gulf to north-west <span>India</span>. There are possible records of this form from <span>Hong Kong</span> and <span>South Korea</span>.</p>
<p>The <b><span>Mongolian gull</span></b> (<i>L. (vegae/cachinnans) mongolicus</i>) may be classed as a subspecies of the Caspian gull, a subspecies of the <span>East Siberian gull</span> or as a species in its own right. It breeds in <span>Mongolia</span> and surrounding areas and migrates south-east in winter.</p>
