<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_biology">Distribution and biology</span></h2>
<p>This <span>weaver</span> occurs in forests, especially in wet <span>habitats</span>. It builds a large coarsely woven <span>nest</span> made of grass and creepers with a 15&#xA0;cm downward facing entrance tunnel hanging from the globular <span>egg</span> chamber. The nest is suspended from a branch in a tree and 2-3 eggs are laid. It nests in pairs but forms small flocks when not breeding.</p>
