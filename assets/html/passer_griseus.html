<p>The <b>northern grey-headed sparrow</b> (<i>Passer griseus</i>), also known as the <b>grey-headed sparrow</b> or <b>common grey-headed sparrow</b>, is a bird species which is resident in much of tropical Africa. It occurs in a wide range of open habitats, including open woodlands and human habitation, often occupying the same <span>niche</span> as the <span>house sparrow</span> does in <span>Eurasia</span>.</p>
<p>The adult northern grey-headed sparrow has a pale grey head with a white moustache stripe, pale brown upperparts, whitish underparts and chestnut wings with a small white shoulder patch. The sexes are similar, but young birds are slightly duller and lack the white wing patch.</p>
<p>There are three subspecies, differing in plumage tone, especially with regard to the darkness of the head.</p>
<p>This <span>sparrow</span> is mainly resident in its range, but there is some seasonal movement, and flocks of up to 50 birds form outside the breeding season.</p>
<p>It builds a cup nest in trees, thatch, or old nests of other birds; 2&#x2013;4 eggs are laid.</p>
<p>This species feeds principally on seeds and grain, like other sparrows, but will readily take insects including <span>termites</span>, especially when feeding young.</p>
<p>The calls include cheeps and chirps, and the typical sparrow churring alarm call.</p>
<p>The northern grey-headed sparrow is replaced in eastern and southern Africa by very similar birds that are sometimes considered races of this species: <span>Swainson's sparrow</span>, the <span>parrot-billed sparrow</span>, the <span>Swahili sparrow</span>, and the <span>southern grey-headed sparrow</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>phylogeny</span> has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al.</p>
