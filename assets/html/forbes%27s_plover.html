<p>The <b>Forbes&#x2019;s plover</b> or <b>Forbes&#x2019;s banded plover</b> (<i>Charadrius forbesi</i>) is a small <span>wader</span>. This <span>plover</span> is resident in much of west Africa, mainly on inland rivers, pools and <span>lakes</span>. Its <span>nest</span> is a scrape lined with small pebbles in rocky uplands. After breeding in the wet season, this bird moves to open <span>grasslands</span>, including airfields and golf courses, in the dry season. It is sometimes seen at pools or <span>reservoirs</span>.</p>
<p>The adult Forbes&#x2019; plover is 20&#xA0;cm in length. It has long wings and a long tail, and therefore looks different from most other small plovers in flight, the exception being the closely related <span>three-banded plover</span> which replaces it in eastern and southern <span>Africa</span> and <span>Madagascar</span>.</p>
<p>The breeding adult has dark brown upperparts, and the underparts are white except for the two black breast bands, separated by a white band, which give this species its common and <span>scientific names</span>. The head is strikingly patterned, with a black crown, brown forehead, white <span>supercilia</span> extending from above the eyes to meet on the back of the neck, and a grey face. The eye ring and the base of the otherwise black <span>bill</span> are red. The sexes are similar.</p>
<p>In non-breeding adults, the breast bands may be dark brown, and the supercilia buff-tinged. Juveniles resemble the non-breeding adult, but are duller.</p>
<p>This species is larger and darker than the <span>three-banded plover</span>. The latter species also has a white forehead and a white wingbar.</p>
<p>Forbes&#x2019;s plover is often seen as single individuals, but may form small flocks. It hunts by sight for insects, worms and other <span>invertebrates</span>. It has a piping <i>peee-oo</i> call.</p>
<p>This species was named for the British zoologist <span>William Alexander Forbes</span>.</p>
