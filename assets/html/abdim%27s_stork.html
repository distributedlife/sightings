<p>The <b>Abdim's stork</b>, (<i>Ciconia abdimii</i>) also known as <b>white-bellied stork</b>, is a black <span>stork</span> with grey legs, red knees and feet, grey <span>bill</span> and white underparts. It has red facial skin in front of eye and blue skin near the bill in breeding season. It is the smallest species of stork, at 73&#xA0;cm (29&#xA0;in) and a weight of just over 1&#xA0;kg (2.2&#xA0;lbs). The female lays two to three eggs and is slightly smaller than the male.</p>
<p>The Abdim's stork is distributed to open habitats throughout <span>Eastern Africa</span>, from <span>Ethiopia</span> south to <span>South Africa</span>. Its diet consists mainly of <span>locusts</span>, <span>caterpillars</span> and other large insects, although the birds will also eat small reptiles, amphibians, mice, crabs and eggs.</p>
<p>Among the smallest storks, this species is welcomed and protected by local <span>African</span> belief as a <span>harbinger</span> of rain and good luck. The name commemorates the <span>Turkish</span> Governor of <span>Wadi Halfa</span> in <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Bey El-Arnaut Abdim</span> (1780&#x2013;1827).</p>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large range, the Abdim's stork is evaluated as <span>Least Concern</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</span>. It is the subject of several nationally-coordinated breeding programs: in the United States, the plan for this species is administered by the <span>Association of Zoos and Aquariums</span> and in Europe by the <span>European Association of Zoos and Aquaria</span>.</p>
