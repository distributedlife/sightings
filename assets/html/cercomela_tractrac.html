<p>The <b>tractrac chat</b> (<i>Cercomela tractrac</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of the <span>Old World flycatcher</span> <span>family</span> Muscicapidae. It is a common resident breeder in southernmost <span>Angola</span>, western <span>Namibia</span> and western <span>South Africa</span>.</p>
<p>Its habitat is <span>Karoo</span> and desert scrub, hummock dunes and gravel plains.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The tractrac chat is 14&#x2013;15&#xA0;cm long with a weight of 20 g. Its tail is white with a dark inverted &#x201C;T&#x201D; at the tip, reminiscent of the pattern shown by several <span>wheatears</span>. The short straight bill and the legs and feet are black. It has a dark eye. The Namib form found on hummock dunes and at the coast has almost white plumage with grey wings and grey tail marking. The south-eastern form, found in gravel plains has brown upperparts with blackish flight feathers and tail markings. Its underparts are white. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile is more mottled than the adult.</p>
<p>This species is smaller than the <span>Karoo chat</span> which also has the white of the outer tail feathers extending to the tip. It is paler and greyer than <span>Familiar</span> and <span>sickle-winged chats</span>, both of which have a darker rump.</p>
<p>The tractrac chat has a soft fast "tactac" song and a loud chattering territorial defence call.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>The tractrac chat builds a cup-shaped nest of straw and leaves on the ground, usually under a bush or shrub. It lays two to three red eggs. This species is monogamous, mating for life.</p>
<p>It is usually seen singly or in pairs. It forages from the ground for <span>insects</span> including butterflies, bees, wasps, locusts and ants. Prey is typically taking in a short flight.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status">Conservation status</span></h2>
<p>This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 1,000,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;. The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>
