<p>The <b>Lesser White-toothed Shrew</b> (<i>Crocidura suaveolens</i>) is a tiny <span>shrew</span> with a widespread distribution in <span>Africa</span>, <span>Asia</span> and <span>Europe</span>, but not in most of <span>Spain</span>, north&#x2013;west <span>France</span> and mainland <span>Great Britain</span>. Its preferred habitat is <span>scrub</span> and gardens and it feeds on <span>insects</span>, <span>worms</span>, <span>slugs</span>, <span>snails</span>, <span>newts</span> and small <span>rodents</span>. The closely related Asian Lesser White-toothed Shrew (<i><span>Crocidura shantungensis</span></i>) was once included in this species, but is now considered to be a separate species.</p>
<p>Like the <span>common shrew</span>, a female lesser white-toothed shrew and her young may form a "caravan" when foraging for food or seeking a place of safety: each shrew grips the tail of the shrew in front so that the group stays together.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Scilly_Shrew">The Scilly Shrew</span></h2>
<p>The population found on the <span>Isles of Scilly</span>, off the southwest coast of <span>England</span>, was once thought to be a sub-species, <i>Crocidura suaveolens cassiteridum</i>, and is known as the Scilly Shrew. Skull and tooth measurements of individuals from Scilly are found to be intermediate in size of those in the <span>Channel Islands</span> and the darker fur of the Scilly specimens is not considered a valid reason for the naming of a sub-species. It is unusual in that it can be found on the islands' beaches. Archaeological remains indicate that it was present on the islands in the <span>bronze age</span>, so it may have been present before the Isles of Scilly became separated from the European continent, or may have migrated from the Channel Islands or Europe onboard ships.</p>
<p>In July 1924 W N Blair found an unknown species of shrew on <span>Gugh</span> and sent it to the mammal expert, Mr <span>Hinton</span>, at the <span>British Museum</span>. This specimen, held at the museum, is the <span>type</span> for the species. Ten years earlier H N Robinson found an unknown rodent at Old Town <span>St Mary's</span> and sent it to Mr F W Smalley "who had the largest collection of rodents in the country". The Scillonian name for the animal is "<i>teak</i>" or "<i>teke</i>". In 2010, a Scilly shrew made headlines on <span>BBC Cornwall</span> when it <span>stowed away</span> on the passenger ferry <span>RMV Scillonian III</span>. It was only discovered as the ship was about to arrive in Penzance. The shrew was flown back to the Isles of Scilly the next day on a <span>Skybus</span> plane and then released back into its natural environment.</p>
