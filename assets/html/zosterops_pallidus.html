<p>There are six <span>subspecies</span>. Traditionally, the western <span>nominate</span> group and the eastern <i>capensis</i> group have been treated as separate species; the Orange River white-eye (<i>Z. pallidus</i>) and the Cape white-eye (<i>Z. capensis</i>). The latter can be further divided into two subgroups, the south-western <i>capensis</i> subgroup and the eastern <i>virens</i> subgroup (the so-called green white-eye). All subspecies <span>interbreed</span> where they come into contact (including members of the nominate group with members of the <i>capensis</i> group of both subgroups in <span>Free State</span>), but some authorities (e.g. <span>IOC</span>) maintain the Cape and Orange River white-eyes as separate species.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>This species is about 12&#xA0;cm long with rounded wings, strong legs, and a conspicuous ring of white feathers round the eyes. The upperparts are green, and the throat and vent are bright yellow. The members of the nominate group have a pale yellow central belly with peach coloured flanks. The members of the <i>capensis</i> subgroup have a grey breast and belly, while the <i>virens</i> subgroup have a greenish-yellow breast and belly.</p>
<p>They are very vocal, and constantly keep in touch with soft trilled <i>pee</i>, <i>pree</i> or <i>pirreee</i> callnotes. The song consists of repeated long jerky phrases of sweet reedy notes, varying in pitch, volume and temp, usually starting off with <i>teee teee</i> or <i>pirrup pirrup</i> notes, then becoming a fast rambled jumble of notes, which may incorporate mimicked phrases of other birdcalls.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>This is a sociable species forming large flocks outside the breeding season. It builds a cup nest in a tree and lays 2-3 unspotted pale blue eggs. The eggs hatch in 11&#x2013;12 days, and fledging occurs in another 12&#x2013;13 days. The peak breeding season is September to December.</p>
<p>The Cape white-eye feeds mainly on insects, but also soft fleshy flowers, nectar, fruit and small grains. It readily comes to bird feeders.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>It is found in a wide range of densely to lightly wooded habitats in <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Namibia</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Lesotho</span> and <span>Swaziland</span>. Most populations are resident, but some perform minor seasonal movements.</p>
