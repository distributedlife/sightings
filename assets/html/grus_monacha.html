<p>The <b>hooded crane</b> (<i>Grus monacha</i>) is a small, dark <span>crane</span>. It has a grey body. The top of the neck and head is white, except for a patch of bare red skin above the eye. It is one of the smallest cranes, but is still a fairly large bird, at 1&#xA0;m (3.3&#xA0;ft) long, a weight of 3.7&#xA0;kg (8.2&#xA0;lbs) and a wingspan of 1.87&#xA0;m (6.2&#xA0;ft).</p>
<p>The hooded crane breeds in south-central and south-eastern <span>Siberia</span>. Breeding is also suspected to occur in <span>Mongolia</span>. Over 80% of its population winters at <span>Izumi</span>, southern <span>Japan</span>. There are also wintering grounds in <span>South Korea</span> and <span>China</span>. There are about 100 hooded cranes wintering in Chongming Dongtan, Shanghai every year. Dongtan Nature reserve is the largest natural wintering site in the world. In December 2011, a hooded crane was seen overwintering at the Hiwassee Refuge in southeastern Tennessee, well outside its normal range. In February 2012, one was seen at Goose Pond in southern Indiana, and is suspected to be the same bird, which may have migrated to North America by following <span>sandhill cranes</span>.</p>
<p>The estimated population of the species is 9,500 individuals. The major threats to its survival are wetland loss and degradation in its wintering grounds in China and South Korea as a result of reclamation for development and dam building. Conservation activities have been taken since 2008. Local universities, NGOs and communities are working together for a better and safer wintering location.</p>
<p>The hooded crane is evaluated as <span>Vulnerable</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of <span>CITES</span>. A society, <i>Grus monacha</i> International Aid (&#x767D;&#x5934;&#x9E64;&#x7684;&#x6545;&#x4E8B;), has been formed to find ways to protect the species.</p>
