<p>The <b>Oriental Turtle Dove</b> or <b>Rufous Turtle Dove</b> (<i>Streptopelia orientalis</i>) is a member of the <span>bird</span> family Columbidae, <span>doves</span> and pigeons.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h2>
<p>Both the names Oriental Turtle Dove or Rufous Turtle Dove have been used for this species. It has been suggested that the name Rufous Turtle Dove should be used for the western form <i>meena</i>, and Oriental Turtle Dove for the nominate <i>orientalis</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>Oriental Turtle Dove has two distinct migratory northern races, <i>S. o. orientalis</i> in the central <span>Siberian</span> <span>taiga</span>, and <i>S. o. meena</i> in open woodland in central <span>Asia</span>. There are also two non-migratory southern races. Two other races have been described from East Asian islands.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Morphology">Morphology</span></h2>
<p>This small species is very similar in plumage to its European counterpart, the <span>Turtle Dove</span>. It is a little larger than that species, particularly in the case of <i>orientalis</i>, about the same size as a <span>Collared Dove</span>. It shares the black and white striped patch on the side of its neck, but the breast is less pink, and the orange-brown wing <span>feathers</span> of Turtle Dove are replaced with a browner hue, and darker centres. The tail is wedge shaped, like the Turtle Dove. The flight is more relaxed and direct than that of its relative.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_the_forms_orientalis_and_meena">Differences between the forms <i>orientalis</i> and <i>meena</i></span></h3>
<p>Differences in the pattern of the tail in the forms <i>S. o. orientalis</i> and <i>S. o. meena</i> have been widely reported (<i>orientalis</i> having a grey tip to the tail and more black in the outer web of the outer tail-feathers, <i>meena</i> having a white tip to its tail like Turtle Dove and less black in the outer web of the outer tail-feathers). However, these are not consistent differences: both forms can have white or grey tail-bands, and <i>orientalis</i> can have little black in the outer webs of the outer tail-feathers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocalisations">Vocalisations</span></h2>
<p>The call is quite different from the purr of the Turtle Dove. It is a four-syllable <i>her-her-oo-oo</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_distribution">Status and distribution</span></h2>
<p>The westernmost race, <i>meena</i>, breeds just into the <span>Western Palearctic</span> region.</p>
<p>Southernmost populations are resident, but most other birds <span>migrate</span> south to winter in <span>Pakistan</span> and <span>India</span>, the <span>Maldives</span>, where it is the national bird, and southern <span>Japan</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vagrancy">Vagrancy</span></h3>
<p>This species is a rare vagrant to northern and western <span>Europe</span>. A 1986 review by Erik Hirschfeld in <i><span>Dutch Birding</span></i> listed around 30 records, mostly in autumn and winter. Prior to this, it had been suggested that European records referred to escapes from captivity, because of their tameness, the distance from the species' normal breeding range, the suburban habitat of many of the records, and their winter timing; Hirschfeld presented counter-arguments to all these points, and today it is generally accepted that most if not all Rufous Turtle Doves in Europe are wild birds.</p>
<p>In 1994, the <span>British Birds Rarities Committee</span> reviewed the British records of this species and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. Oriental Turtle Dove has occurred a number of times since, including a well-watched bird in Oxfordshire in February 2011, which was found in a <span>birdwatcher</span>'s garden. The house owner used the opportunity to charge a &#xA3;5 fee to view the bird from his kitchen window and up to 500 people queued to see the bird.</p>
<p><i>S. o. orientalis</i> occurs as a rarity in western <span>Alaska</span> and <span>British Columbia</span>.</p>

<p>Two white <span>eggs</span>, as for all pigeons and doves, are laid in a twig nest in a tree.</p>
