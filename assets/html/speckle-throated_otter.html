<p>The <b>spotted-necked otter</b> (<i>Hydrictis maculicollis</i>), or <b>speckle-throated otter</b>, is an <span>otter</span> native to <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The spotted-necked otter is a smallish species, with males measuring 71 to 76&#xA0;cm (28 to 30&#xA0;in) from nose to rump, and weighing 5.7 to 6.5&#xA0;kg (13 to 14&#xA0;lb), while females are 57 to 61&#xA0;cm (22 to 24&#xA0;in) and 3.0 to 4.7&#xA0;kg (6.6 to 10.4&#xA0;lb). The tail is long and muscular, measuring 39 to 44&#xA0;cm (15 to 17&#xA0;in) in both sexes. Like many other otters, it is sleek and has webbed paws for swimming. Females have two pairs of <span>teats</span>, and while males have a large <span>scrotum</span>, the <span>penis</span> is hidden beneath the skin, to reduce drag while swimming.</p>
<p>Although there is considerable variation among individuals, the <span>fur</span> is usually reddish to chocolate brown and marked with creamy or white blotches over the chest and throat. The head is broad with a short muzzle, small rounded ears and a hairless <span>nose pad</span>. The teeth are adapted for consuming fish, with large sharp upper canine teeth, curved lower canines, and sharp <span>carnassial</span> teeth. The jaws are similarly adapted, with the <span>mandibular fossa</span> fitting so snugly into the <span>condyle</span> on the lower jaw that the latter cannot move sideways, making it easier to capture and hold fish.</p>
<p>Although up to five subspecies have previously been identified, these most likely represent a natural variation in appearance between individuals, and no subspecies are currently recognised.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Spotted necked otters are found in lakes and larger rivers throughout much of Africa south of 10&#xB0;N. They are common in Lake Victoria and across Zambia, but for some unexplained reason often are absent from what appear to be suitable habitats, such as the lakes and rivers, of East Africa and the Zambezi below <span>Victoria Falls</span>. No evidence of spotted-necked otters venturing into salt water has been found.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior_and_biology">Behavior and biology</span></h2>
<p>Spotted-necked otters feed primarily on fish, typically less than 20&#xA0;cm (7.9&#xA0;in) in length, but also eat frogs and small crustaceans, especially when fish are in short supply. They are <span>diurnal</span>, and appear to hunt entirely by sight using short dives of less than twenty seconds each in clear water with good visibility. Larger prey items are carried ashore while smaller items are eaten while treading water. Known predators on the otters include <span>crocodiles</span> and <span>African fish eagles</span>.</p>
<p>The otters are sometimes found in family groups, but appear to be social only under certain conditions. Males and females are separated for at least part of the year. They normally hunt alone, except when mothers are training their young, and are not territorial, sheltering through the night in short burrows, rock crevices, or patches of dense vegetation. On land, they travel mainly by the use of regular paths, and rarely move more than 10&#xA0;m (33&#xA0;ft) from river or lake banks. As with many other otters, these paths are marked by "sprainting" sites in which they habitually defecate and urinate.</p>
<p>Spotted-necked otters are very vocal, uttering high, thin whistles and rapid shrill chatters. The female bears a litter of up to three young after a gestation period of about two months. The young are born blind and helpless, and the mother cares for them for almost a year.</p>
<p>They are known to use rocks to smash open shells. This rudimentary use of tools indicates the intelligence of the otter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The spotted-necked otter is in decline, mostly due to <span>habitat destruction</span> and pollution of its clear-water habitats. It is hunted as <span>bushmeat</span>.</p>
