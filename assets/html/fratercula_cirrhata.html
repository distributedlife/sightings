<p>The <b>tufted puffin</b> (<i>Fratercula cirrhata</i>) also known as <b>crested puffin</b>, is a relatively abundant medium-sized <span>pelagic</span> <span>seabird</span> in the <span>auk</span> (Alcidae) family found throughout the <span>North Pacific Ocean</span>. It is one of three species of <span>puffin</span> that make up the <i>Fratercula</i> genus and is easily recognizable by its thick red <span>bill</span> and yellow tufts.</p>

<p>Tufted puffins are around 35&#xA0;cm (15&#xA0;in) in length with a similar wingspan and weigh about three quarters of a kilogram (1.6&#xA0;lbs). Birds from the western Pacific population are somewhat larger than those from the eastern Pacific, and male birds tend to be slightly larger than females.</p>

<p>They are mostly black with a white facial patch, and, typical of other puffin species, feature a very thick bill which is mostly red with some yellow and occasionally green markings. Their most distinctive feature and namesake are the yellow tufts (<span>Latin</span>: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cirri</i></span>) that appear annually on birds of both sexes as the summer reproductive season approaches. Their feet become bright red and their face also becomes bright white in the summer. During the feeding season, the tufts moult off and the plumage, beak and legs lose much of their lustre.</p>
<p>As among other alcids, the wings are relatively short, adapted for diving, underwater swimming and capturing prey rather than gliding, of which they are incapable. As a consequence, they have thick, dark <span>myoglobin</span>-rich breast muscles adapted for a fast and <span>aerobically</span> strenuous wing-beat cadence, which they can nonetheless maintain for long periods of time.</p>

Juveniles</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Juvenile tufted puffins resemble winter adults, but with a grey-brown breast shading to white on the belly, and a shallow, yellowish-brown bill. Overall, they resemble a horn-less and unmarked <span>rhinoceros auklet</span> (<i>Cerorhinca monocerata</i>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The tufted puffin was first described in 1769 by German zoologist <span>Peter Simon Pallas</span>. Its generic name is derived from the <span>Latin</span> <i>Fratercula</i> "little brother", and the specific epithet <i>cirrhata</i> means "tufted". Since it may be more closely related to the <span>Rhinoceros Auklet</span> than the other puffins, it is sometimes placed in the <span>monotypic</span> genus <i><b>Lunda</b></i>.</p>
<p>The juveniles, due to their similarity to <i>C. monocerata</i>, were initially mistaken for a distinct <span>species</span> of a monotypic <span>genus</span>, and named <i><b>Sagmatorrhina lathami</b></i> ("<span>Latham</span>'s saddle-billed auk", from <i>sagmata</i> "saddle" and <i>rhina</i> "nose").</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_Habitat">Distribution and Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Tufted puffins form dense <span>breeding colonies</span> during the summer reproductive season from <span>British Columbia</span>, throughout southeastern <span>Alaska</span> and the <span>Aleutian Islands</span>, <span>Kamchatka</span>, the <span>Kuril Islands</span> and throughout the <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span>. While they share some habitat with <span>horned puffins</span> (<i>F. corniculata</i>), the range of the tufted puffin is generally more eastern. They have been known to nest in small numbers as far south as the northern Channel Islands, off southern California. However, the last confirmed sighting at the Channel Islands occurred in 1997.</p>
<p>Tufted puffins typically select <span>islands</span> or cliffs that are relatively inaccessible to <span>predators</span>, close to productive waters, and high enough that they can take to the air successfully. Ideal habitat is steep but with a relatively soft soil substrate and <span>grass</span> for the creation of <span>burrows</span>.</p>
<p>During the winter feeding season, they spend their time almost exclusively at sea, extending their <span>range</span> throughout the North Pacific and south to <span>Japan</span> and <span>California</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Breeding takes place on isolated islands: over 25,000 pairs have been recorded in a single colony off the coast of <span>British Columbia</span>. The nest is usually a simple burrow dug with the bill and feet, but sometimes a crevice between rocks is used instead. It is well-lined with vegetation and feathers. Courtship occurs through skypointing, strutting, and billing. A single <span>egg</span> is laid, usually in June, and incubated by both parents for about 45 days. <span>Fledglings</span> leave the nest at between 40 and 55 days.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h3>
<p>Tufted puffins feed almost exclusively on <span>fish</span>, which they catch by diving from the surface. Adults may also feed on <span>squid</span> or other invertebrates. Feeding areas can be located far offshore from the nesting areas. Puffins can store large quantities of small fish in their bills and carry them to their chicks.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Predators_and_threats">Predators and threats</span></h3>
<p>Tufted puffins are preyed upon by various avian raptors such as <span>snowy owls</span>, <span>bald eagles</span> and <span>peregrine falcons</span>, and mammals like the <span>Arctic foxes</span>. Foxes seem to prefer the puffin over other birds, making the bird a main target. Choosing inaccessible cliffs and entirely mammal-free islands protects them from terrestrial predators while laying eggs in burrows is effective in protecting them from egg-scavengers like <span>gulls</span> and <span>ravens</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_with_humans">Relationship with humans</span></h2>
<p>The <span>Aleut</span> and <span>Ainu people</span> of the North Pacific traditionally hunted tufted puffin for food and feathers. Skins were used to make tough <span>parkas</span> worn feather side in and the silky tufts were sewn into ornamental work. Currently, harvesting of tufted puffin is illegal or discouraged throughout its range.</p>
<p>The tufted puffin is a familiar bird on the coasts of the Russian Pacific coast, where it is known as <i>toporik</i> (&#x442;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x438;&#x43A;) &#x2013; roughly meaning "axe-bill" &#x2013;, while the other puffins are collectively called <i>t&#xFA;piki</i> (&#x442;&#x443;&#x301;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x438;) in Russian. <i>F. cirrhata</i> is the namesake of one of its main breeding sites, <i>Kamen Toporkov</i> ("Tufted Puffin Rock") or <i>Ostrov Toporkov</i> ("Tufted Puffin Island"), an islet offshore <span>Bering Island</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation_status_in_Puget_Sound">Conservation status in Puget Sound</span></h3>
<p>Many rules and regulations have been set out to try to conserve fishes and shorebirds in Puget Sound. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) of Washington State has created aquatic reserves surrounding Smith and Minor Islands. Over 36,000 acres (150&#xA0;km) of tidelands and seafloor habitat were included in the proposed aquatic reserve. Not only do these islands provide the necessary habitat for many seabirds such as tufted puffins and marine mammals, but this area also contains the largest kelp beds in all of Puget Sound. In addition, Protection Island reserve has also been off limits to the public to aid marine birds in breeding. Protection Island contains one of the last two nesting colonies of puffins in Puget Sound, and about 70% of the tufted puffin population nests on this island.</p>
