<p>The <b>white-headed buffalo weaver</b> or <b>white-faced buffalo-weaver</b> (<i>Dinemellia dinemelli</i>) is a species of <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> in the family <span>Ploceidae</span> native to <span>East Africa</span>. The buffalo part of its name derives from its habit of following the <span>African buffalo</span>, feeding on disturbed insects. Two subspecies are recognized.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</span></h2>
<p>The white-headed buffalo weaver was first described by the German <span>naturalist</span> <span>Eduard R&#xFC;ppell</span> in 1845.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>Two subspecies of the white-headed buffalo weaver are now recognized.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The white-headed buffalo weaver is 170&#x2013;190&#xA0;mm (6.7&#x2013;7.5&#xA0;in) in length and 57&#x2013;85&#xA0;g (2.0&#x2013;3.0&#xA0;oz) in weight. In addition to its white head and underparts, the white-headed buffalo weaver has a vividly orange-red rump and undertail coverts. Its thighs are dark brown. Narrow white bands can be found on the wings. Both sexes are similar in plumage and hard to differentiate. The bill is conical and black. <i>D. d. dinemelli</i> has a brown tail, whereas <i>D. d. boehmi</i> has a black tail.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>The white-headed buffalo weaver is native to the African countries of <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Sudan</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, and <span>Uganda</span>. It prefers habitats such as <span>savanna</span>, and shrublands, but especially dry brush and <span>Acacia</span> thickets.</p>

<p>Like the most weavers, it is a <span>gregarious</span> bird which forages on the ground for insects, especially <span>beetles</span> and <span>butterflies</span>, fruits, and seeds, often in groups with <span>starlings</span>. Foraging is often done in groups of 3&#x2013;6 birds. Its sound is parrot-like: &#x201C;skwieeer&#x201D;, &#x201C;kiiyerr&#x201D;, a ringing and repetitious &#x201C;tew&#x201D;. In addition, variable sounds as chuckles and whistles can be heard at breeding and roosting sites. The sounds are slow and drawn out. They also make trills: &#x201C;tsu-weely-weely-wair&#x201D;. They often perch in trees and hang upside-down and can be very noisy. Breeding and roosting is done in groups and they can be defensive against intruders, usually by making noise. Altercations are rarely fatal and usually vocal. Males display to females by spreading their wings to show their white wing-patches and red-orange <span>tail-coverts</span>.</p>
<p>Breeding pairs are monogamous and nests are built together. The breeding season depends according to rainfall and varies according to local conditions. Nest materials are pushed together, not interwoven, to form an oval 570 millimetres (22&#xA0;in) wide. A short entrance tube opens downwards and is about 2&#xA0;to 4 metres (6.6&#x2013;13.1&#xA0;ft) above the ground. Soft materials line the inner portions of the nest, which usually has several rooms, with defensive thorny branches on the outside. A large tree will have several of their nests, which other birds such as the <span>African Pygmy-falcon</span> are known to use instead of building their own. The female incubates 3&#x2013;5 greyish to pale blue eggs with red, brown and olive markings for 11&#x2013;14 days. Both parents feed the chicks.</p>
