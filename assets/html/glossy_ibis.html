<p>The <b>glossy ibis</b> (<i>Plegadis falcinellus</i>) is a <span>wading bird</span> in the <span>ibis</span> family Threskiornithidae.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>This is the most widespread ibis species, breeding in scattered sites in warm regions of <span>Europe</span>, <span>Asia</span>, <span>Africa</span>, <span>Australia</span>, and the <span>Atlantic</span> and <span>Caribbean</span> regions of the <span>Americas</span>. It is thought to have originated in the <span>Old World</span> and spread naturally from Africa to northern <span>South America</span> in the 19th century, from where it spread to North America. This species is <span>migratory</span>; most European birds winter in Africa, and in North America birds from north of <span>the Carolinas</span> winter farther south. Birds from other populations may disperse widely outside the breeding season. While generally declining in Europe it has recently established a breeding colony in southern <span>Spain</span>, and there appears to be a growing trend for the Spanish birds to winter in <span>Britain</span> and <span>Ireland</span>, with at least 22 sightings in 2010.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Glossy ibises undertake dispersal movements after breeding and are very nomadic. The more northerly populations are fully migratory and travel on a broad front, for example across the <span>Sahara Desert</span>. Populations in temperate regions breed during the local spring, while tropical populations nest to coincide with the rainy season. Nesting is often in mixed-species colonies. When not nesting, flocks of over 100 individuals may occur on migration, and during the winter or dry seasons the species is usually found foraging in small flocks. Glossy ibises often roost communally at night in large flocks, with other species, occasionally in trees which can be some distance from wetland feeding areas.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>Glossy ibises feed in very shallow water and nest in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation such as reeds, <span>papyrus</span> or rushes) and low trees or bushes. They show a preference for marshes at the margins of lakes and rivers but can also be found at <span>lagoons</span>, <span>flood-plains</span>, wet <span>meadows</span>, <span>swamps</span>, <span>reservoirs</span>, <span>sewage</span> ponds, paddies and irrigated farmland. It is less commonly found in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, <span>salt marshes</span> and coastal lagoons. Preferred roosting sites are normally in large trees which may be distant from the feeding areas.</p>
<p>The nests are usually a platform of twigs and vegetation positioned at least 1&#xA0;m (3.3&#xA0;ft) above water, sometimes up to 7&#xA0;m (23&#xA0;ft) in tall, dense stands of emergent vegetation, low trees or bushes.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diet">Diet</span></h2>
<p>The diet of the glossy ibis is variable according to the season and is very dependent on what is available. Prey includes adult and larval <span>insects</span> such as aquatic <span>beetles</span>, <span>dragonflies</span>, <span>damselflies</span>, <span>grasshoppers</span>, <span>crickets</span>, <span>flies</span> and <span>caddisflies</span>, <span>Annelida</span> including <span>leeches</span>, <span>molluscs</span> (e.g. <span>snails</span> and <span>mussels</span>), <span>crustaceans</span> (e.g. <span>crabs</span> and <span>crayfish</span>) and occasionally <span>fish</span>, <span>amphibians</span>, <span>lizards</span>, small <span>snakes</span> and nestling birds.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>This species is a mid-sized ibis. It is 48&#x2013;66&#xA0;cm (19&#x2013;26&#xA0;in) long, averaging around 59.4&#xA0;cm (23.4&#xA0;in) with an 80&#x2013;105&#xA0;cm (31&#x2013;41&#xA0;in) wingspan. The <span>culmen</span> measures 9.7 to 14.4&#xA0;cm (3.8 to 5.7&#xA0;in) in length, each wing measures 24.8&#x2013;30.6&#xA0;cm (9.8&#x2013;12.0&#xA0;in), the tail is 9&#x2013;11.2&#xA0;cm (3.5&#x2013;4.4&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> measures 6.8&#x2013;11.3&#xA0;cm (2.7&#x2013;4.4&#xA0;in). The body mass of this ibis can range from 485 to 970&#xA0;g (1.069 to 2.138&#xA0;lb). Breeding adults have reddish-brown bodies and shiny bottle-green wings. Non-breeders and juveniles have duller bodies. This species has a brownish bill, dark facial skin bordered above and below in blue-gray (non-breeding) to cobalt blue (breeding), and red-brown legs. Unlike herons, ibises fly with necks outstretched, their flight being graceful and often in <span>V formation</span>.</p>
<p>Sounds made by this rather quiet ibis include a variety of croaks and grunts, including a hoarse <i>grrrr</i> made when breeding.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>The glossy ibis is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies. Glossy ibises are threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss through drainage, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants.</p>
<p>The common name black <span>curlew</span> may be a reference to the glossy ibis and this name appears in <span>Anglo-Saxon</span> literature, indicating that it may have bred in early <span>medieval</span> <span>England</span> but <span>Yalden</span> and Albarella do not mention this species.</p>
