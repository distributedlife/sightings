<p>The <b>black-chested snake eagle</b> (<i>Circaetus pectoralis</i>) is a large <span>African</span> bird of prey of the Accipitridae family. It resembles other <span>snake-eagles</span> and was once believed to be conspecific with the <span>short-toed snake eagle</span> and <span>Beaudouin's snake eagle</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Identification">Identification</span></h2>
<p>The main identifying character of this bird is its dark brown head and chest, to which it owes its name. In flight the dark head contrasts with the underparts and underwings, which are white apart from dark barring on the flight feathers and tail. The upperparts are dark brown, and the eye is yellow.</p>
<p>The female is similar to, but larger than the male, and the juvenile is rufous.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Call">Call</span></h2>
<p>The call is a whistled <i>kwo kwo kwo kweeoo</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>This species can be found throughout southern Africa from <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Sudan</span> in the north to <span>South Africa</span> in the south and <span>Angola</span> in the southwest. Due to its wide distribution the species is not endangered.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat">Habitat</span></h2>
<p>It inhabits different habitats, providing it can find open terrain to hunt on, trees to perch and nest in, and sufficient food supply. This includes semi-arid or even desert areas.</p>
<p>As its name indicates, this bird feeds mostly on <span>snakes</span>, but will also prey on lizards, small mammals and frogs.</p>
<p>The female will lay only one <span>egg</span> per clutch, which is incubated for 50 days. The chick leaves the nest after 3 months.</p>
