<p><b>Fischer's starling</b> (<i>Spreo fischeri</i>) is a <span>bird</span> which is an uncommon resident breeder from southern <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Somalia</span> to eastern <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. It is found in dry open <span>acacia</span> thornbush.</p>
<p>The English and scientific names commemorate the German explorer <span>Gustav Fischer</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The adult of this 18&#xA0;cm (7.1&#xA0;in) long, 51&#xA0;g (1.8&#xA0;oz) <span>starling</span> has mainly dully ash-grey plumage except for a white lower chest, belly and undertail. It has a white iris and dark bill. The sexes are alike, but the juvenile has browner plumage, a brown iris and a dull yellow lower mandible. There are no subspecies.</p>
<p>This species has a number of calls, but the most familiar is a wheezing <i>cree-wee-creewoo</i>. There is also a loud whistle and a metallic song.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>Fischer's starling usually nests in thorn trees, typically 2.5&#xA0;m (8&#xA0;ft 2&#xA0;in) above the ground. The roofed nest is made from grasses and lined with feathers. It has a ramp and opening in its side. Up to six red-spotted blue eggs make up the clutch, and are laid in April to May and September to November.</p>
<p>Both parents feed the chicks, assisted by helpers, which are typically subadult or unmated birds.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>Like other starlings, Fischer's starling is an <span>omnivore</span>, and sometimes takes fruit and berries, but its diet is mainly <span>insects</span>, taken from the ground. It normally forages alone or in pairs, but will form mixed flocks with <span>wattled starlings</span>.</p>
