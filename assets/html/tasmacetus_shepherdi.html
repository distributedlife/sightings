<p><b>Shepherd's beaked whale</b> (<i>Tasmacetus shepherdi</i>), also commonly called <b>Tasman's beaked whale</b> or simply the <b>Tasman whale</b>, is a <span>cetacean</span> of the <span>family</span> <span>Ziphidae</span>. The <span>whale</span> has not been studied extensively. Only four confirmed at sea sightings have been made and 42 <span>strandings</span> recorded (as of 2006). It was first known to science in 1937, being named by <span>W. R. B. Oliver</span> after George Shepherd, former curator of the <span>Wanganui Museum</span>, who collected the type specimen near &#x14C;hawe on the south <span>Taranaki</span> coast, <span>North Island</span>, New Zealand, in 1933.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_description">Physical description</span></h2>
<p>Adults can reach lengths of 6 metres (20&#xA0;ft) to 7.1 metres (23&#xA0;ft) and weigh about 2.32 to 3.48 tons. At birth they may be about 3 metres (9.8&#xA0;ft) long. They are robust and large-bodied for beaked whales, having a bluff <span>melon</span> and a long, dolphin-like beak. It is the only species of ziphiid with a full set of functional teeth (17 to 27 pairs in both the upper and lower jaws). Adult males also have a pair of tusks at the tip of the lower jaw. They are dark brown dorsally and cream-colored ventrally, with a pale band extending up from the flipper and another pale area extending as a swathe on the posterior flank. The tall, falcate dorsal fin is set about two-thirds the way along the back.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Population_and_distribution">Population and distribution</span></h2>
<p>No population estimates exist for Shepherd's beaked whale. As of 2006, there have been about 42 stranding records of the species from New Zealand (including the <span>Chatham Islands</span>, 24), <span>Argentina</span> (7), <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> (6), Australia (3), and the <span>Juan Fern&#xE1;ndez Islands</span> (2). There have been five unconfirmed sightings (mostly from New Zealand), as well as a "probable" sighting near <span>Shag Rocks</span> and four confirmed sightings&#x2014;the first two confirmed sightings occurred in 1985, within a few minutes of each other, off the Tristan da Cunha group (first sighting at 37&#xB0;18'S, 12&#xB0;32'W); the third in 2002 near <span>Gough Island</span> (40&#xB0;19'S, 9&#xB0;53'W); and the fourth in 2004 south of <span>Tasmania</span> (48&#xB0;50'S, 150&#xB0;06'E). In January 2012, a group of up to a dozen of this species were photographed and filmed by the <span>Australian Antarctic Division</span> south of <span>Portland</span>, <span>Victoria</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Four of the confirmed sightings of this species involved three to six individuals (one group included a calf) in waters from 350 metres (1,150&#xA0;ft) to 3,600 metres (11,800&#xA0;ft) deep, while a 2012 sighting involved as many as ten to twelve individuals. The animals surfaced several times, giving a "small, bushy" blow (only visible from the aerial sightings), before arching to dive. Some were observed to come to the surface at a steep angle like many other ziphiids, raising their head and beaks out of the water.</p>
<p>The species is seldom seen because of its deep, offshore distribution in waters where sighting conditions can be difficult (the "<span>Roaring Forties</span>" and "Furious Fifties").</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conservation">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>There are no reports of this species being hunted or killed accidentally by humans. Shepherd's beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (<span>Pacific Cetaceans MOU</span>).</p>
