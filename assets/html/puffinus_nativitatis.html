<p>The <b>Christmas shearwater</b> (<i>Puffinus nativitatis</i>) is a medium-sized <span>shearwater</span> of the <span>tropical</span> <span>Central Pacific</span>. It is a poorly known species due to its remote nesting habits, and it has not been extensively studied at sea either.</p>
<p>It is one member of a very ancient lineage of the small <i>Puffinus</i> species. Its only close living relative is the <span>Gal&#xE1;pagos shearwater</span> (<i>P. subalaris</i>), as indicated by <span>mtDNA</span> <span>cytochrome b</span> <span>sequence</span> data and <span>morphology</span>. Until recently, that species was considered conspecific with <span>Audubon's shearwater</span>.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>It is a slender-bodied <span>shearwater</span>, about 36&#xA0;cm long, with a wingspan of around 75&#xA0;cm, and weighs around 350&#xA0;g. The Christmas shearwater has dark <span>plumage</span> all over, generally blackish-grey with a rusty-brown tinge, slightly paler on the underside of the bird, and with some small edging of white under the chin and pale fringes to the upperwing coverts. It has brown-grey feet and a dark bill and eyes. Both sexes are alike, as are the young after <span>fledging</span>. <span>Nestlings</span> are covered in dark grey <span>down feathers</span>.</p>
<p>The species closely resembles the <span>sooty</span> (<i>Puffinus griseus</i>) and <span>short-tailed shearwaters</span> (<i>P. tenuirostris</i>), but has dark brown underwings and is smaller. The short tail of the Christmas shearwater does not appear blunt except when spread, but in flight usually tapers to a point, enhanced by the feet which protrude beyond the tail-tip. The Christmas shearwater often flies in a leisurely way like related <span>Procellariidae</span>, and thus can be mistaken for a petrel. In particular, a very similar species is the extremely rare <span>Fiji petrel</span> (<i>Pseudobulweria macgillivrayi</i>), a <span>gadfly petrel</span>-like relative of the shearwaters. It looks very similar in <span>morphology</span> and colouration, but the bulbous head and rather thin long bill &#x2013; typical for shearwaters &#x2013; distinguish <i>P. nativitatis</i> from the slim-headed thick-billed Fiji petrel.</p>

Nestling in the <span>Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Christmas shearwater nests on remote islands of the Central Pacific: the <span>Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</span>, <span>Tuamotu</span>, the <span>Marshall Islands</span>, <span>Kiritimati</span> (for which the species is named) and <span>Sala-y-G&#xF3;mez</span>. It has become locally <span>extinct</span> on a number of islands, including <span>Wake Island</span>. Outside of the breeding season it ranges across the Pacific, having been recorded off the coast of <span>Mexico</span> and <span>Guatemala</span> in the east, and <span>Bonin Islands</span> in the west. Further south it is rare, having been recorded off <span>Fiji</span> only twice (one time in early to mid-May).</p>
<p>Like its relatives it feeds at sea, predominantly on <span>squid</span>, and <span>fish</span>, mostly <span>flying fish</span> (Exocoetidae) and <span>goatfish</span> (Mullidae). It is highly <span>pelagic</span> and is dependent on predatory fish such as <span>tuna</span> driving prey to the surface. As mentioned above, it does not only have the dramatic stiff-winged "shearing" (<span>dynamic soaring</span>) flight technique which gave the shearwaters their common name. In addition to it, it may use the <span>plesiomorphic</span> flight technique of <span>petrels</span> and similar <span>Procellariidae</span>, moving about with slow, leisurely wingbeats.</p>
<p>The Christmas shearwater nests on sandy islands with good cover. It nests on the surface, underneath dense cover (such as <span>naupakas</span>, <i>Scaevola</i>), or under rock outcroppings. It lays one white <span>egg</span>, the timing of laying varying from island to island, on some islands breeding throughout the year. The egg is incubated for around 50 days. The time taken to <span>fledge</span> varies depending on the <span>season</span>, ranging from 60 to 100 days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_and_conservation">Status and conservation</span></h3>
<p>Although few specific studies have been conducted on the Christmas shearwaters, petrels and shearwaters are threatened worldwide by <span>fishing</span>, ingestion of <span>plastic waste</span>, and habitat degradation. For example on <span>Laysan Island</span> the <span>introduced</span> <span>rabbits</span> degraded the scrub cover, leaving adults, chicks and eggs vulnerable to overheating, and introduced <span>black rats</span> took eggs and chicks. In 1985, the population on <span>Sala-y-G&#xF3;mez</span>, a nature <span>sanctuary</span>, was estimated at 5,000. With its wide range and considerable numbers, the Christmas shearwater is considered a species of <span>least concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>.</p>
