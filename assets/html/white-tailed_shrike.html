<p>The <b>White-tailed Shrike</b> (<i>Lanioturdus torquatus</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> bird from the family <span>Platysteiridae</span>. It is also commonly known as the <b>Chatshrike</b>. It occurs only in western <span>Angola</span> and <span>Namibia</span> in thorn scrub. It forages from ground level, where it hops about in large bounds and upright posture, to 25m above ground, scanning for insects. The very short tail, with a small black mark at the tip of the central two feathers, is always carried down, never sticking up. Its range of calls includes loud ringing territorial whistles.</p>
<p>This curious bird, which some consider to have close affinities with the <span>batises</span> and others the <span>bushshrikes</span>, was discovered in 1837 by <span>James Edward Alexander</span> in the <span>Naukluft Mountains</span> of Namibia. Waterhouse subsequently described it in 1838, the name <i>Lanioturdus</i> ('shrike-thrush') reflecting the uncertainty of its classification, and <i>torquatus</i> denoting 'collared'. The sexes have a similar appearance.</p>
<p>It is a common, endemic, breeding resident in the region, small seasonal migrations taking place. Its favoured habitat is scrub-savanna, thornbush and <span>mopane</span>-veld. It is found singly or in pairs during the breeding season, and in small groups at other times. It is a clumsy flier with shallow and rapid wingbeats like other batises.</p>
<p>Nests are usually located in thorny <span>acacias</span> and are constructed by both sexes. Nests are deep, neat well-moulded cups incorporating spider-web and placed about 3 metres above ground. The usual clutch is 2-3 eggs pale-green to white with sparse reddish-brown spots. Only the female incubates the eggs.</p>
