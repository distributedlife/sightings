<p>The <b>merlin</b> (<i>Falco columbarius</i>) is a small <span>species</span> of <span>falcon</span> from the <span>Northern Hemisphere</span>. A <span>bird of prey</span> once known colloquially as a <b>pigeon hawk</b> in North America, the merlin breeds in the northern <span>Holarctic</span>; some <span>migrate</span> to <span>subtropical</span> and northern <span>tropical</span> regions in winter.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name">Name</span></h2>
<p>The name merlin is derived from the Dutch Merlijn, vernacular merlin, with the dropping of the 's' from smerlijn, smerlin in turn is derived from Middle French esmerillon. In German the synonymous names Schmerl, Schmirl, Schmerlin came from Middle High German smirle, via Old High German smerlo, smiril. The 's' has been abraded over time in the German language. In the Icelandic or the Faroese language's it's name is smyrill or smyril.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="European_and_North_American_variants">European and North American variants</span></h2>
<p>Some regard the <span>North American</span> and <span>Eurasian</span> (<i>F. columbarius</i>) <span>populations</span> as two distinct <span>species</span>. The first modern <span>taxonomist</span> to describe the merlin was <span>Carl Linnaeus</span>, a Swede who reported his <span>type specimen</span> came from America. Thirteen years after Linnaeus's description <span>Marmaduke Tunstall</span> recognized the Eurasian birds as a distinct <span>taxon</span> <i>aesalon</i> in his <i>Ornithologica Britannica</i>. If two species of merlins are recognized, the <span>Old World</span> birds would thus bear the <span>scientific name</span> <i>F. aesalon</i>.</p>

<p>The merlin is 24&#x2013;33&#xA0;cm (9.4&#x2013;13.0&#xA0;in) long with a 50&#x2013;73&#xA0;cm (20&#x2013;29&#xA0;in) wingspan. Compared with most other small <span>falcons</span>, it is more robust and heavily built. Males average at about 165&#xA0;g (5.8&#xA0;oz) and females are typically about 230&#xA0;g (8.1&#xA0;oz). There is considerable variation, however, throughout the birds' range and&#x2014;in particular in <span>migratory</span> populations&#x2014;over the course of a year. Thus, adult males may weigh 125&#x2013;210&#xA0;g (4.4&#x2013;7.4&#xA0;oz), and females 190&#x2013;300&#xA0;g (6.7&#x2013;10.6&#xA0;oz). Each wing measures 18.2&#x2013;23.8&#xA0;cm (7.2&#x2013;9.4&#xA0;in), the tail measures 12.7&#x2013;18.5&#xA0;cm (5.0&#x2013;7.3&#xA0;in) and the <span>tarsus</span> measures 3.7&#xA0;cm (1.5&#xA0;in). Such <span>sexual dimorphism</span> is common among <span>raptors</span>; it allows males and females to hunt different <span>prey</span> animals and decreases the <span>territory</span> size needed to feed a mated pair.</p>
<p>The male merlin has a blue-grey back, ranging from almost black to <span>silver</span>-grey in different <span>subspecies</span>. Its underparts are <span>buff</span>- to orange-tinted and more or less heavily streaked with black to reddish brown. The female and immature are brownish-grey to dark brown above, and whitish buff spotted with brown below. Besides a weak whitish <span>supercilium</span> and the faint dark <span>malar</span> stripe&#x2014;which are barely recognizable in both the palest and the darkest birds&#x2014;the face of the merlin is less strongly patterned than in most other falcons. <span>Nestlings</span> are covered in pale buff <span>down feathers</span>, shading to whitish on the belly.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <span>remiges</span> are blackish, and the tail usually has some 3&#x2013;4 wide blackish bands, too. Very light males only have faint and narrow medium-grey bands, while in the darkest birds the bands are very wide, so that the tail appears to have narrow lighter bands instead. In all of them, however, the tail tip is black with a narrow white band at the very end, a pattern possibly <span>plesiomorphic</span> for all falcons. Altogether, the tail pattern is quite distinct though, resembling only that of the <span>aplomado falcon</span> (<i>F. berigora</i>) and (in light merlins) some typical <span>kestrels</span>. The eye and <span>beak</span> are dark, the latter with a yellow <span>cere</span>. The feet are also yellow, with black claws.</p>
<p>Light American males may resemble the <span>American kestrel</span> (<i>F. sparverius</i>, not a typical kestrel), but merlin males have a grey back and tail rather than the reddish-brown of the kestrels. Light European males can be distinguished from kestrels by their mainly brown wings. In the north of <span>South Asia</span>, wintering males may be confused with the <span>red-necked falcon</span> (<i>F. chicquera</i>) if they fly away from the observer and the head (red on top in <i>F. chicquera</i>) and underside (finely barred with black in <i>F. chicquera</i>) are not visible.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systematics">Systematics</span></h2>
<p>The relationships of the merlin are not resolved to satisfaction. In size, shape and coloration, it is fairly distinct among living falcons. The red-necked falcon is sometimes considered more closely related to the merlin than other falcons, but this seems to be a coincidence due to similar hunting habits; it could not be confirmed in more recent studies. Indeed, the merlin seems to represent a lineage distinct from other living falcons since at least the <span>Early Pliocene</span>, some 5 Ma (<span>million years ago</span>). As suggested by <span>biogeography</span> and <span>DNA sequence</span> data, it might be part of an ancient non-<span>monophyletic</span> <span>radiation</span> of <i>Falco</i>s from Europe to <span>North America</span>, alongside the ancestors of forms such as the American kestrel (<i>F. sparvierus</i>), and the aplomado falcon (<i>F. femoralis</i>) and its relatives. A relationship with the red-necked falcon (<i>F. chicquera</i>) was once proposed based on their <span>phenetic</span> similarity, but this is not considered likely today.</p>

</div>
<p>In that regard, it is interesting to note a <span>fossil</span> falcon from the Early <span>Blancan</span> (4.3&#x2013;4.8 Ma) Rexroad Formation of <span>Kansas</span>. Known from an almost complete right <span>coracoid</span> (specimen <span>UMMP</span> V29107) and some <span>tarsometatarsus</span>, <span>tibiotarsus</span> and <span>humerus</span> pieces (V27159, V57508-V57510, V57513-V57514), this prehistoric falcon was slightly smaller than a merlin and apparently a bit more stout-footed, but otherwise quite similar. It was part of the Fox Canyon and Rexroad Local Fauna's, and may have been the ancestor of the living merlins or its close relative. With its age quite certainly pre-dating the split between the Eurasian and North American merlins, it agrees with the idea of the merlin lineage originating in North America, or rather the colonization thereof. After <span>adapting</span> to its <span>ecological niche</span>, ancient merlins would have spread to Eurasia again, with <span>gene flow</span> being interrupted as the <span>Beringia</span> and <span>Greenland</span> regions became icebound in the <span>Quaternary glaciation</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subspecies">Subspecies</span></h3>
<p>That the merlin has a long-standing presence on both sides of the Atlantic is evidenced by the degree of genetic distinctness between Eurasian and North American populations. Arguably, they might be considered distinct species, with <span>gene flow</span> having ceased at least a million years ago, but probably more.</p>
<p>By and large, color variation in either group independently follows <span>Gloger's Rule</span>. The <span>Pacific temperate rain forest</span> subspecies <i>suckleyi'</i>s males are almost uniformly black on the upperside and have heavy black blotches on the belly, whereas those of the lightest <span>subspecies</span>, <i>pallidus</i>, have little non-dilute <span>melanin</span> altogether, with grey upperside and reddish underside pattern.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>Merlins inhabit fairly open country, such as <span>willow</span> or <span>birch</span> scrub, <span>shrubland</span>, but also <span>taiga</span> forest, <span>parks</span>, <span>grassland</span> such as <span>steppe</span> and <span>prairies</span>, or <span>moorland</span>. They are not very <span>habitat</span>-specific and can be found from <span>sea level</span> to the <span>treeline</span>. In general, they prefer a mix of low and medium-height vegetation with some trees, and avoid dense forests as well as treeless <span>arid</span> regions. During <span>migration</span> however, they will utilize almost any habitat.</p>
<p>Most of its populations are migratory, wintering in warmer regions. Northern European birds move to southern <span>Europe</span> and <span>North Africa</span>, and North American populations to the southern <span>USA</span> to northern <span>South America</span>. In the milder <span>maritime</span> parts of its breeding range, such as <span>Great Britain</span>, the <span>Pacific Northwest</span> and western <span>Iceland</span>, as well as in <span>Central Asia</span>, it will merely desert higher ground and move to coasts and lowland during winter. The migration to the breeding grounds starts in late February, with most birds passing through the USA, <span>Central Europe</span> and southern <span>Russia</span> in March and April, and the last stragglers arriving in the breeding range towards the end of May. Migration to winter quarters at least in Eurasia peaks in August/September, while e.g. in <span>Ohio</span>, just south of the breeding range, <i>F. c. columbarius</i> is typically recorded as a southbound migrant as late as September/October.</p>
<p>In Europe, merlins will roost communally in winter, often with <span>hen harriers</span> (<i>Circus cyaneus</i>). In North America, communal roosting is rare, and merlins are well known for fiercely attacking any birds of prey that they encounter, even adult <span>eagles</span>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Merlins rely on speed and agility to hunt their prey. They often hunt by flying fast and low, typically less than 1&#xA0;m (3.3&#xA0;ft) above the ground, using trees and large shrubs to take prey by surprise. But they actually capture most prey in the air, and will "tail-chase" startled birds. Throughout its native range, the merlin is one of the most able aerial predators of small to mid-sized birds, more versatile if anything than the larger <span>hobbies</span> (which prefer to attack in mid-air) and the more nimble <span>sparrowhawks</span> (which usually go for birds resting or sleeping in dense growth). Breeding pairs will frequently hunt cooperatively, with one bird flushing the prey toward its mate.</p>
<p>The merlin will readily take prey that is flushed by other causes, and can for example be seen tagging along <span>sharp-shinned hawks</span> (<i>Accipiter striatus</i>) to catch birds that escape from this ambush predator into the open air. It is quite unafraid, and will readily attack anything that moves conspicuously. Merlins have even been observed trying to "catch" <span>automobiles</span> and <span>trains</span>, and to feed on captive birds such as those snared in the <span>mist nets</span> used by <span>ornithologists</span>. Even under adverse conditions, one in 20 targets is usually caught, and under good conditions almost every other attack will be successful. Sometimes, merlins <span>cache</span> food to eat it later.</p>
<p>In particular during the breeding season, most of the prey are smallish birds weighing 10&#x2013;40&#xA0;g (0.35&#x2013;1.41&#xA0;oz). Almost any such <span>species</span> will be taken, with local preferences for whatever is most abundant&#x2014;be it <span>larks</span> (Alaudidae), <span>pipits</span> (<i>Anthus</i>) or <span>house sparrows</span> (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)&#x2014;and inexperienced <span>yearlings</span> always a favorite. Smaller birds will generally avoid a hunting merlin if possible. Even in the <span>Cayman Islands</span> (where it only occurs in winter), <span>Bananaquits</span> were noted to die of an apparent <span>heart attack</span> or <span>stroke</span>, without being physically harmed, when a merlin went at them and they could not escape.</p>
<p>Larger birds (e.g. <span>sandpipers</span>, <span>flickers</span> and even <span>rock pigeons</span> as heavy as the merlin itself) and other animals&#x2014;<span>insects</span> (especially <span>dragonflies</span> and <span>moths</span>), small <span>mammals</span> (especially <span>bats</span> and <span>voles</span>) and <span>reptiles</span>&#x2014;complement its diet. These are more important outside the breeding season, when they can make up a considerable part of the merlin's diet. But for example in <span>Norway</span>, while small birds are certainly the breeding merlin's staple food, exceptional breeding success seems to require an abundance of <i><span>Microtus</span></i> voles.</p>
<p><span>Corvids</span> are the primary threat to eggs and nestlings. Adult merlins may be preyed on by larger <span>raptors</span>, especially <span>peregrine falcons</span> (<i>F. peregrinus</i>), <span>eagle-owls</span> (e.g., <span>great horned owl</span>, <i>Bubo virginianus</i>), and larger <i><span>Accipiter</span></i> <span>hawks</span> (e.g., <span>northern goshawk</span>, <i>A. gentilis</i>). In general however, <span>carnivorous</span> birds avoid merlins due to their aggressiveness and agility.</p>

Nestlings</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Breeding occurs typically in May/June. Though the pairs are <span>monogamous</span> at least for a breeding season, <span>extra-pair copulations</span> have been recorded. Most nest sites have dense vegetative or rocky cover; the merlin does not build a proper nest of its own. Most will use abandoned <span>corvid</span> (particularly <i><span>Corvus</span></i> crow and <i><span>Pica</span></i> magpie) or <span>hawk</span> nests which are in <span>conifer</span> or mixed tree stands. In <span>moorland</span>&#x2014;particularly in the <span>UK</span>&#x2014;the female will usually make a shallow scrape in dense <span>heather</span> to use as a nest. Others nest in crevices on cliff-faces and on the ground, and some may even use buildings.</p>
<p>Three to six (usually 4 or 5) eggs are laid. The rusty brown eggs average at about 40&#xA0;mm &#xD7;&#xA0;31.5&#xA0;mm (1.57&#xA0;in &#xD7;&#xA0;1.24&#xA0;in). The incubation period is 28 to 32 days. <span>Incubation</span> is performed by the female to about 90%; the male instead hunts to feed the family. <span>Hatchlings</span> weigh about 13&#xA0;g (0.46&#xA0;oz). The young <span>fledge</span> after another 30 days or so, and are dependent on their parents for up to 4 more weeks. Sometimes first-year merlins (especially males) will serve as a "nest helper" for an adult pair. More than half&#x2014;often all or almost all&#x2014;eggs of a <span>clutch</span> survive to hatching, and at least two-thirds of the hatched young fledge. However, as noted above, in years with little supplementary food only one young in 3 may survive to fledging. The merlin becomes <span>sexually mature</span> at one year of age and usually attempts to breed right away. The oldest wild bird known as of 2009 was recorded in its 13th winter.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_in_falconry">Use in falconry</span></h3>
<p>In medieval Europe, merlins were popular in <span>falconry</span>: the <span>Book of St. Albans</span> listed it as " the falcon for a lady ". Today, they are still occasionally trained by falconers for hunting smaller birds, but due to <span>conservation</span> restrictions this is not as common as in the past. In countries where they are allowed for falconry they are highly regarded. Though the merlin is only slightly larger than the <span>American kestrel</span> in dimensions, it averages about one third larger by weight, with this weight mostly being extra muscle that gives it greater speed and endurance than the kestrel. Though the most common prey pursued by merlins in falconry are sparrows and starlings, they are capable of taking small game birds such as dove and quail. Their eagerness to hunt leads them to pursue falconry lures avidly, and they will put on entertaining displays chasing a swung lure.</p>

<p>Altogether, the merlin is not particularly rare, and due to this and its wide range it is considered a Species of <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span>. Its numbers are&#x2014;except in the <span>Asian</span> part of its range, where the situation is less well determined&#x2014;regularly <span>censused</span>. In about every major country it inhabits, many hundreds to many thousands are found, ranging from a "mere" 250-300 pairs in <span>Belarus</span> to perhaps as many as 30,000 pairs of <i>aesalon</i> in <span>European Russia</span> as determined in 1993. It is listed on <span>CITES Appendix II</span> and on a local level protected as other <span>birds of prey</span>; while some countries allow to capture merlins, e.g. for falconry, international trade requires an export permit.</p>
<p>By far the most serious long-term threat to these birds is <span>habitat destruction</span>, especially in their breeding areas. Ground-nesting populations in <span>moorland</span> have a preference for tall heather, and are thus susceptible to overmanagement by burning vast tracts instead of creating a <span>habitat mosaic</span> containing old and new growth. Still, the merlin is rather euryoecious and will even live in settled areas, provided they have the proper mix of low and high vegetation, as well as sufficient prey (which is usually the case) and nesting sites (which is a common limiting factor).</p>
<p>In North America, the species seems to have been more widespread in the past, or perhaps its range has shifted northwards: <i>F. c. columbarius</i> was an uncommon breeding bird in <span>Ohio</span> before the 20th century, but e.g. in <span>Seneca County</span>, as early as the 1900s even single adults were rarely seen in the breeding season. It is encountered in Ohio as a passage migrant and rarely as a winter guest, though two recent nestings have been confirmed. Changing land-use in Ohio mainly turned forest into <span>agricultural</span> land and thus is not very likely to have rendered the region inhospitable to the merlin; <span>global warming</span> on the other hand cannot be dismissed as a reason, given that the merlin is essentially a <span>subarctic</span> species that barely ranges even into <span>temperate</span> climes. Also, it may be that the number of merlins wintering in the northern USA has increased during the 20th century.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most frequent cause of accidental death for individuals is collision with man-made objects, particularly during attacks. This may account for almost half of all premature deaths of merlins. In the 1960s and 1970s, <span>organochlorine pesticides</span> were responsible for declines&#x2014;particularly in <span>Canada</span>&#x2014;due to eggshell thinning and subsequent brood failure, and compromising the <span>immune system</span> of adults. This has since been remedied with restrictions on the use of <span>DDT</span> and similar chemicals, and numbers have rebounded. Overall, merlin stocks appear globally stable; while they may decline temporarily in places, they will usually increase again eventually, suggesting that this phenomenon is due to the fluctuations of supplementary food stocks discussed above.</p>
