<p>The <b>green wood hoopoe</b> (<i>Phoeniculus purpureus</i>) is a large, up to 44&#xA0;cm (17&#xA0;in) long, <span>near-passerine</span> tropical bird native to <span>Africa</span>. It is a member of the family <span>Phoeniculidae</span>, the <span>wood hoopoes</span>, and was formerly known as the <b>red-billed wood hoopoe</b>.</p>
<p>The green wood hoopoe is a common resident breeder in the forests, woodlands and suburban gardens of most of <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>. It is found in groups of up to a dozen or so birds with only one breeding pair. The breeding female lays two to four blue eggs in a natural tree hole or old barbet nest and incubates them for about 18 days. On hatching, she and the nestlings are fed by the rest of the group, even after they have fledged and left the nest hole. The group is fearless in defence of the nestlings against intruders. This species is parasitised by the <span>greater</span> and <span>lesser honeyguide</span>.</p>
<p>This abundant species is a metallic dark green, with a purple back and very long diamond-shaped purple tail. Distinctive white markings on the wings and white chevrons on the tail edges make it easily identifiable, as does its long, thin, curved red bill. Sexes are similar, but immatures have a black bill.</p>
<p>The green wood hoopoe is an insect-eating species. It feeds mainly on the ground, <span>termite</span> mounds, or on tree trunks, and forms flocks outside the breeding season. Its specialised claws enable it to cling easily to the underside of branches while closely inspecting the bark for insects.</p>
<p>This conspicuous bird advertises its presence with its loud <i>Kuk-uk-uk-uk-uk</i> call and other vocalisations.</p>
<p>Widespread and common throughout its large range, the green wood hoopoe is assessed as <span>Least Concern</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species.</p>
