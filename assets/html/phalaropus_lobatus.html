<p>The <b>red-necked phalarope</b> (<i>Phalaropus lobatus</i>) is a small <span>wader</span>. This <span>phalarope</span> breeds in the <span>Arctic</span> regions of <span>North America</span> and <span>Eurasia</span>. It is <span>migratory</span>, and, unusually for a wader, winters at sea on tropical oceans.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Red-necked phalarope is about 18&#xA0;cm (7.1&#xA0;in) in length, with lobed toes and a straight, fine bill. The breeding female is predominantly dark grey above, with a chestnut neck and upper breast, black face and white throat. They have a white wing stripe which helps distinguish this bird from the similar <span>Wilson's phalarope</span>.The breeding male is a duller version of the female. They have lobed toes to assist with their swimming. Young birds are grey and brown above, with buff underparts and a black patch through the eye. In winter, the plumage is essentially grey above and white below, but the black eyepatch is always present. They have a sharp call described as a <i>whit</i> or <i>twit</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The typical avian sex roles are reversed in the three phalarope species. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than males. The females pursue and fight over males, and will defend their mate from other females until the clutch is complete and the male begins incubation. The males perform all incubation and chick-rearing activities, while the females may attempt to find another mate. If a male loses his eggs to predation, he may re-pair with his original mate or a new female to try again. Once it becomes too late in the breeding season to start new nests, females begin their southward migration, leaving the males to incubate the eggs and look after the young. <span>Clutch size</span> is usually 4 splotchy olive-buff eggs, but can be fewer. The young mainly feed themselves and are able to fly within 20 days of hatch.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>When feeding, a red-necked phalarope will often swim in a small, rapid circle, forming a small whirlpool. This behaviour is thought to aid feeding by raising food from the bottom of shallow water. The bird will reach into the center of the vortex with its bill, plucking small <span>insects</span> or <span>crustaceans</span> caught up therein. On the open ocean, they are often found where converging currents produce upwellings. During migration, some flocks stop over on the open waters at the mouth of the <span>Bay of Fundy</span> to take advantage of food stirred up by tidal action.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h3>
<p>Almost all of the nonbreeding season is spent in open water. As this species rarely comes into contact with humans, it can be unusually tame.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h3>
<p>The red-necked phalarope is one of the species to which the <i>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</i> (<span>AEWA</span>) applies.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_Britain_and_Ireland">In Britain and Ireland</span></h2>
<p>The red-necked phalarope is a rare and localised breeding species in the <span>British Isles</span>, which lie on the extreme edge of its world range. The most reliable place for them is the <span>Shetland Isles</span>, particularly the <span>Loch of Funzie</span> on <span>Fetlar</span>, with a few birds breeding elsewhere in Scotland in the <span>Outer Hebrides</span> (e.g. at <span>Loch na Muilne</span>, where a "phalarope watchpoint" has been set up) and sometimes the Scottish Mainland in <span>Ross-shire</span> or <span>Sutherland</span>. They have also bred in western <span>Ireland</span>, although there are very few breeding records since the 1970s.</p>
<p>The tracking of a tagged bird from Fetlar unexpectedly revealed that it wintered with a North American population in the tropical Pacific Ocean; it took a 16,000&#xA0;mi (26,000&#xA0;km) round trip across the Atlantic via Iceland and Greenland, then south down the Eastern seaboard of America, across the Caribbean and Mexico, before ending up off the coast of Ecuador and Peru. For this reason, it is suspected that the Shetland population could be an offshoot of a North American population rather than the geographically closer Scandinavian population that is believed to winter in the Arabian Sea.</p>
