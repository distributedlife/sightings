<p>The <b>red-cheeked cordon-bleu</b> (<i>Uraeginthus bengalus</i>) is a small <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span>. This <span>estrildid finch</span> is a resident breeding bird in drier regions of tropical sub-<span>Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>. Red-cheeked cordon-bleu has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 7,700,000&#xA0;km&#xB2;.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systematics">Systematics</span></h2>
<p>When he first described the red-cheeked cordon-bleu in his 1766 edition of <span>Systema Naturae</span>, <span>Carl Linnaeus</span> assigned it to the genus <i><span>Fringilla</span></i>. It was later moved to the genus <i><span>Uraeginthus</span></i>, along with the rest of the cordon-bleus and grenadiers. The red-cheeked cordon-bleu, the <span>blue-capped cordon-bleu</span>, and the <span>blue waxbill</span>&#x2014;form a <span>species group</span> within the genus. Further, the red-cheeked cordon-bleu may form a <span>superspecies</span> with the blue waxbill, with which it shares similar habitats.</p>
<p>There are four subspecies, which differ primarily in the amount of blue on the face and underparts of the females.</p>

<p>On 15 February 2013, the <span>American Ornithologists' Union</span> marked this species in their database as a <span>taxonomic synonym</span> to the <i><span>incertae sedis</span></i> family containing the <span>bananaquit</span>. No explanation was given, and it would seem this may have been a mistake.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>Like other members of its genus, the red-cheeked cordon-bleu is a very small finch, measuring only 12.5&#x2013;13&#xA0;cm (4.9&#x2013;5.1&#xA0;in) in length. It weighs 9.9&#xA0;g (0.35&#xA0;oz) on average, with known extremes in wild populations ranging from 8.9&#x2013;11&#xA0;g (0.31&#x2013;0.39&#xA0;oz). The adult male has uniformly brown upperparts, pale blue breast, flanks and tail and a yellow belly. There is a red patch on each cheek, but this can rarely appear orange or even yellow. Females are similar but duller, and lack the cheek spot. Immature birds are like the female, but with blue restricted to the face and throat.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h3>
<p>Its contact call is a thin, high-pitched piping, often repeated, and variously transcribed as <i>siii siii</i> or <i>tsee tsee</i>. The song is more complex, consisting of 4&#x2013;6 high-pitched notes, the last of which is longer, lower and more burry. Described as "rhythmic but lazy", it has been transcribed as <i>wit-sit-diddley-diddley-ee-ee</i>. Unlike many other <span>passerines</span>, but like all cordon-bleu species, female red-cheeked cordon-bleus sing; they also help to defend a small area around their <span>nest</span> site. Their song is less complex than that of the males, and they sing less frequently. Female song peaks primarily before egg-laying, and is thought to help with <span>pair bond</span> maintenance or breeding synchronization.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Habitat_and_range">Habitat and range</span></h2>
<p>The red-cheeked cordon-bleu is common and widespread across much of central and eastern Africa. Its range stretches from the <span>West African</span> countries of <span>Senegal</span>, <span>Gambia</span> and southwestern <span>Mauritania</span> east through southern <span>Mali</span>, southern <span>Niger</span>, southern <span>Chad</span> and southern <span>Sudan</span> to <span>Ethiopia</span> and northwestern and southwestern <span>Somalia</span>, and then south to southern <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, eastern <span>Angola</span>, northern and western <span>Zambia</span>, southern <span>Tanzania</span> and northern <span>Mozambique</span>. It has also been introduced to the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> of <span>Hawaii</span> and <span>Oahu</span>. It has been found one time (in 1924) on <span>Cape Verde</span> and was recorded in the <span>Maadi</span> area in northern <span>Egypt</span> during the mid-1960s; the latter birds may have been escaped cage birds, as there have been no records since.</p>
<p>It is found in all habitats except forest interiors, at elevations ranging from sea level to 2,430&#xA0;m (7,970&#xA0;ft).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>It is frequently seen at open dry <span>grassland</span> and <span>savanna</span> habitats as well as around human habitation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>The red-cheeked cordon-bleu is a <span>granivore</span>, feeding principally on grass <span>seeds</span>, but also on <span>millet</span> and other small seeds. It is also known to feed sporadically on <span>beeswax</span>. Larger granivores, such as the <span>pin-tailed whydah</span> will chase cordon-bleus from food sources, limiting the feeding opportunities of the smaller birds and affecting their foraging success.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breeding">Breeding</span></h3>
<p>The <span>nest</span> is a large domed <span>grass</span> structure with a side entrance in a tree, bush or thatch into which 4&#x2013;5&#xA0;white <span>eggs</span> are laid.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin">Origin</span></h2>
<p>Origin and <span>phylogeny</span> has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aviculture">Aviculture</span></h2>
<p>The red-cheeked cordon-bleu is reported to be "among the most popular exotic finches". While it has no special housing requirements, its habit of roosting on open branches (rather than in a nest or other protected area) makes it sensitive to low temperatures. During the breeding season, captive males become very aggressive towards each other, and birds disturbed during incubation will typically leave the nest.</p>
