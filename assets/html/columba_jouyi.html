<p>The <b>Ryukyu wood pigeon</b> (<i>Columba jouyi</i>), otherwise known as the <b>silver-banded</b> or <b>silver-crescented pigeon</b> is an <span>extinct</span> species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>Columba</span> genus in the <span>Columbidae</span> family. This wood pigeon was <span>endemic</span> to the <span>Laurel forest</span> habitat.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Generallity">Generallity</span></h2>
<p>It is an <span>extinct</span> <span>species</span> of <span>pigeon</span> that was <span>endemic</span> to islands in the <span>Okinawa archipelago</span> south-west of the <span>Japanese</span> mainland. In the Okinawa group, it has been recorded from <span>Iheyajima</span>, <span>Izenajima</span>, <span>Okinawa proper</span> and the nearby islet <span>Yagachijima</span>. In the <span>Kerama Retto</span> to the west of Okinawa, it was found on <span>Zamamijima</span>, whereas in the <span>Dait&#x14D;</span> group, some 300&#xA0;km to the SE of Okinawa, it occurred on both major islets, <span>Kita Dait&#x14D;jima</span> and <span>Minami Dait&#x14D;jima</span>. In earlier times, it was most likely also found on other islands near Okinawa, such as <span>Iejima</span>. The species' scientific name honors Stejneger's friend, the specimen collector <span>Pierre Louis Jouy</span>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extinction">Extinction</span></h2>
<p>Like all species of Japanese wood pigeons, the Ryukyu wood pigeon was very susceptible to habitat destruction. It required substantial areas of undisturbed subtropical forest to thrive. <span>Iejima</span>, for example, was largely deforested for settlement and agriculture even before scientific exploration began, which explains the absence of records from this island. The species was last recorded on Okinawa in 1904, probably succumbing to hunting. In the Dait&#x14D; group, it disappeared after 1936 due to these small islands being completely deforested by settlement and construction activity prior to <span>World War II</span>. It was presumed to continue to exist on the outlying islands in the Okinawa group, but has never been found again.</p>
<p>Theoretically, there is sufficient habitat remaining in the mountains of Okinawa. Still, the military activity in World War II and hunting by the Japanese garrison would probably have yielded sightings, if birds still had existed there. More puzzling is the absence of <i>any</i> records from <span>Tokashikijima</span> in the Kerama Retto, which, despite being small, has still mostly intact forest cover even today; Zamamijima, where the species is known to have occurred is smaller still and situated farther away from the Okinawan mainland.</p>
