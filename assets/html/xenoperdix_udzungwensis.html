<p>The <b>Udzungwa forest partridge</b> (<i>Xenoperdix udzungwensis</i>) also known as <b>Udzungwa partridge</b> is a small, approximately 29 centimetres (11&#xA0;in) long, boldly barred, brownish <span>partridge</span> with rufous face, grey underparts, olive-brown crown and upperparts. It has a red <span>bill</span>, brown <span>iris</span> and yellow legs. Both sexes are similar.</p>
<p>Discovered only in 1991, this bird was first noticed as a pair of strange feet in a cooking pot in a Tanzanian forest camp. It inhabits and is <span>endemic</span> to forests of the <span>Udzungwa Mountains</span> in <span>Tanzania</span>. A second population from the <span>Rubeho Highlands</span> was initially believed to be a well-marked <span>subspecies</span>, but is now recognized to be specifically distinct. The diet consists mainly of <span>beetles</span>, <span>ants</span> and seeds.</p>
<p>Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size, limited range and overhunting in some areas, the Udzungwa forest partridge is classified as <span>Endangered</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> of Threatened Species.</p>
