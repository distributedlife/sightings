<p>The <b>pigeon guillemot</b> (<i>Cepphus columba</i>) is a species of bird in the <span>auk</span> family, Alcidae. It is <span>endemic</span> to the <span>Pacific Ocean</span>. It closely resembles the other members of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Cepphus</span></i>, particularly the <span>black guillemot</span>, which is slightly smaller and lacks dark wing lines.</p>
<p>Adult birds have black bodies with a white wing patch broken by a black wedge, a thin dark bill and red legs and feet. In winter, the upper parts are mottled grey and black and the underparts are white. They walk well and habitually have an upright posture.</p>
<p>Their breeding habitat is rocky shores, cliffs and islands on northern often forming small loose colonies. They usually lay their eggs in rocky cavities near water, but will often nest in any available cavity including caves, disused burrows of other seabirds and even old bomb casings. Unlike many alcids, pigeon guillemots are <span>diurnal</span> and lay two <span>eggs</span>. Because they can feed their chicks constantly throughout the day, the chicks <span>fledge</span> faster than equivalent sized auks that are only provisioned at night.</p>
<p>Pigeon guillemots range across the Northern Pacific from the <span>Kuril Islands</span> and the <span>Kamchatka Peninsula</span> in <span>Siberia</span> to coasts in western <span>North America</span> from <span>Alaska</span> to <span>California</span>. After the breeding season birds in Alaska <span>migrate</span> south to open waters, whereas some birds from California move north to the waters off <span>British Columbia</span>. Birds usually return to their natal colony to breed.</p>
<p>They dive for food from the surface, swimming underwater, feeding on <span>benthic</span> prey, which is usually obtained close to shore. They mainly eat fish and other aquatic animals, particularly <span>sculpins</span>, <span>sandfish</span> (<i>Trichodon</i>), <span>cods</span>, <span>capelin</span>, and <span>crabs</span>. Chick diet varies slightly, with more fish than invertebrates, particularly <span>rockfish</span>.</p>
