<p>The <b>Eurasian eagle-owl</b> (<i>Bubo bubo</i>) is a species of <span>eagle owl</span> resident in much of <span>Eurasia</span>. It is sometimes called the <b>European eagle-owl</b> and is, in <span>Europe</span>, where it is the only member of its genus besides the <span>snowy owl</span> (<i>B. scandiacus</i>), occasionally abbreviated to just <b>eagle-owl</b>. In India, it is often called the <b>Indian great horned owl</b>, though this may cause confusion with the similarly named American bird. It is one of the largest species of owl, and females can grow to a total length of 75 centimetres (30&#xA0;in), with a wingspan of 188 centimetres (74&#xA0;in), males being slightly smaller. This bird has distinctive ear tufts, the upper parts are mottled black and tawny and the wings and tail are barred. The underparts are buff, streaked with darker colour. The facial disc is poorly developed and the orange eyes give it a fierce expression.</p>
<p>The Eurasian eagle-owl is found in a number of habitats but is mostly a bird of mountain regions, coniferous forests, steppes and remote places. It is a mostly nocturnal <span>predator</span>, hunting for a range of different prey species, predominately small mammals but also birds of varying sizes, reptiles, amphibians, fish, large insects and earthworms. It typically breeds on cliff ledges, in gullies, among rocks or in some other concealed location. The nest is a scrape in which up to six eggs are laid at intervals and which hatch at different times. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and the male provides food for her and when they hatch, for the nestlings as well. Continuing parental care for the young is provided by both adults for about five months.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen <span>subspecies</span> of European eagle owl. With a total range in Europe and Asia of about 32 million square kilometres (12 million square miles) and a total population estimated to be between 250 thousand and 2.5 million individuals, the <span>IUCN</span> lists the bird's conservation status as being of "<span>least concern</span>".</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The eagle owl is a very large and powerful <span>bird</span>, smaller than the <span>golden eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) but larger than the <span>snowy owl</span>. It is sometimes referred to as the world's largest owl, although <span>Blakiston's fish owl</span> (<i>B. blakistoni</i>) is slightly heavier on average and the <span>great grey owl</span> (<i>Strix nebulosa</i>) is slightly longer on average. The eagle owl has a wingspan of 160&#x2013;188&#xA0;cm (63&#x2013;74&#xA0;in), with the largest specimens attaining 200&#xA0;cm (79&#xA0;in). The total length of the species can range from 56 to 75&#xA0;cm (22 to 30&#xA0;in). Females weigh 1.75&#x2013;4.2&#xA0;kg (3.9&#x2013;9.3&#xA0;lb) and males weigh 1.5&#x2013;3&#xA0;kg (3.3&#x2013;6.6&#xA0;lb). In comparison, the <span>barn owl</span> (<i>Tyto alba</i>), the world's most widely distributed owl species, weighs about 500&#xA0;grams (1.1&#xA0;lbs) and the <span>great horned owl</span> (<i>B. virginianus</i>), which fills the eagle owl's <span>ecological niche</span> in <span>North America</span>, weighs around 1.4&#xA0;kg (3.1&#xA0;lbs). Among standard measurements, the tail measures 23&#x2013;31&#xA0;cm (9.1&#x2013;12.2&#xA0;in) long, the <span>tarsus</span> measures 7.4&#x2013;8.8&#xA0;cm (2.9&#x2013;3.5&#xA0;in) and the bill is 4.2&#x2013;5.8&#xA0;cm (1.7&#x2013;2.3&#xA0;in).</p>

<p>Based on the <span>wing chord</span> length (the only measurement taken for many of the less studied subspecies), there is considerable variation across the races, with owls at higher <span>altitudes</span> and more Northern <span>latitudes</span> being the larger varieties. The smallest race is <i>B. b. nikolskii</i>, found in warm, rocky desert-like habitats from eastern <span>Iraq</span> and <span>Iran</span> to <span>Pakistan</span> and <span>Afghanistan</span> and measuring 37.8&#x2013;46&#xA0;cm (14.9&#x2013;18.1&#xA0;in) in wing chord length. The largest race is <i>B. b. yenisseenis</i> of the icy forests of central <span>Siberia</span> to northern <span>Mongolia</span> at 44.3&#x2013;51.8&#xA0;cm (17.4&#x2013;20.4&#xA0;in). Many subspecies still require detailed description and study. Two owls formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian eagle owl are now recognized as distinct species: the <span>pharaoh eagle-owl</span> (<i>B. ascalaphus</i>) and the <span>rock eagle owl</span> (<i>B. bengalensis</i>).</p>
<p>The great size, bulky, barrel-shaped build, ear tufts and orange eyes make this a distinctive species. The ear tufts of males are more upright than those of females. The plumage coloration, across 13 accepted subspecies, however can be somewhat variable. The upperparts may be brown-black to tawny-buff to pale creamy gray, typically showing as dense freckling on the forehead and crown, stripes on the nape, sides and back of the neck, and dark splotches on the pale ground colour of the back, mantle and scapulars. A narrow buff band, freckled with brown or buff, often runs up from the base of the bill, above the inner part of the eye and along the inner edge of the black-brown ear tufts. The rump and upper tail-coverts are delicately patterned with dark vermiculations and fine wavy barring. The facial disc is tawny-buff, speckled with black-brown, so densely on the outer edge of the disc as to form a "frame" around the face. The chin and throat are white continuing down the center of the upper breast. The whole of the underparts except for chin, throat and centre of upper breast is covered with fine dark wavy barring, on a tawny-buff ground colour. Legs and feet (which are feathered almost to the talons) are likewise marked on a buff ground colour but more faintly. The tail is tawny-buff, mottled dark grey-brown with about six black-brown bars. The bill and feet are black, the iris is orange (yellow in some subspecies).</p>

<p>Eagle owls are distributed sparsely through rocky areas but can potentially inhabit a wide range of habitats. They have been found in habitats as diverse as Northern <span>coniferous</span> forests and the edge of vast deserts. They are often found in the largest numbers in areas where cliffs and ravines are surrounded by a scattering of trees and bushes. <span>Taiga</span>, <span>rocky coast lines</span>, <span>steppe</span> and <span>grasslands</span>, may also be visited, largely while hunting in their large territories. Due to their preference for rocky habitats, the species is often found in mountainous areas and can be found at elevations of up to 2,000&#xA0;m (6,600&#xA0;ft) in <span>Europe</span> and 4,500&#xA0;m (14,800&#xA0;ft) in <span>Asia</span>. However, they can also be found at sea level, on islands and even over extensive <span>reed beds</span>. The birds roost by day in rock clefts, ruins, large hollow trees and dense foliage. When perching they adopt an upright stance with plumage closely compressed and may stand tightly beside a tree trunk in a similar fashion to a <span>long-eared owl</span>.</p>
<p>Although found in the largest numbers in areas sparsely populated by humans, farmland is include in their habitat types and they have even been observed living in park-like settings within European cities. Since 2005, at least five couples have nested in <span>Helsinki</span>. This is due in part to feral <span>European rabbits</span> (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) having recently populated the Helsinki area, originally from pet rabbits released to the wild. In June 2007, an eagle owl nicknamed 'Bubi' landed in the crowded <span>Helsinki Olympic Stadium</span> during the European Football Championship qualification match between Finland and Belgium and interrupted the match for six minutes. <span>Finland's national football team</span> have had the nickname <i>Huuhkajat</i> (Finnish for <i>Eurasian eagle-owls</i>) ever since. The owl was named "Helsinki Citizen of the Year" in December 2007.</p>

Threat posture</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Eurasian eagle owl is largely nocturnal in activity, as are most owl species. It has a number of vocalizations that are used at different times. The song, which can be heard at great distance, is a deep resonant <i>ooh-hu</i> with emphasis on the first syllable for the male, and a more high-pitched <i>uh-hu</i> for the female. These calls are repeated at intervals of up to a minute. Other calls include a rather faint <i>OO-OO-oo</i> and a harsh <i>kveck-kveck</i>. Annoyance at close quarters is expressed by bill-clicking and cat-like spitting, and a defensive posture involves lowering the head, ruffling the back feathers, fanning the tail and spreading the wings.</p>
<p>This broad-winged species has a strong direct flight, usually consisting of shallow wing beats and long, fast glides. It has, unusually for an owl, also been known to soar on updrafts on a few occasions. The latter method of flight has led them to be mistaken for <i><span>Buteos</span></i>, which are smaller and quite differently proportioned.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feeding">Feeding</span></h3>
<p>This eagle owl mainly feeds on small mammals in the 200&#x2013;2,000&#xA0;g (0.44&#x2013;4.41&#xA0;lb) weight range, such as <span>voles</span>, <span>rats</span>, <span>mice</span>, <span>rabbits</span> and <span>hares</span>. However, prey can be killed up to the size of both fully-grown <span>foxes</span> and <span>marmots</span> and young <span>deer</span> (up to a mass of 17&#xA0;kg (37&#xA0;lb)), if taken by surprise. In central Europe, <span>hedgehogs</span> are often a favorite prey item, being eaten after the owl skins off their prickly backs. Eagle owls may habitually visit refuse dumps to predate rats. The other significant group of prey for Eurasian eagle owls is other birds and almost any type of bird is potential prey. Common avian prey includes <span>corvids</span>, <span>grouse</span>, <span>woodpeckers</span>, <span>herons</span> and, especially near coastal areas, <span>ducks</span>, <span>seabirds</span> and <span>geese</span>. Other <span>raptors</span>, including large species such as <span>northern goshawks</span> (<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>), <span>peregrine falcons</span> (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>) and the largest <span>buzzards</span>, are regularly attacked as also are almost any other species of owl encountered. When there is an opportunity, they will also prey on <span>reptiles</span>, including large and venomous <span>snakes</span>, <span>frogs</span>, <span>fish</span> and even large <span>insects</span> and <span>earthworms</span>.</p>
<p>Hunting usually consist of the owl watching from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted. The prey is often killed quickly by the eagle owl's powerful talons though is sometimes bitten on the head to be killed as well. Then the prey item is carried off to be swallowed whole or torn into pieces with the bill. Occasionally, they may capture other birds on the wing, including nocturnal migrants which are intercepted in mid-flight. Larger prey (over 3.5&#xA0;kg (7.7&#xA0;lb)) is consumed on the ground which leaves the owl vulnerable to loss of their prey or even predation by predators such as foxes. The dietary preferences of the species frequently overlap with the larger golden eagle but direct competition is uncommon due to differing times of activity between the species.</p>

In winter</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Courtship in the Eurasian eagle owl may involve bouts of "duetting", with the male sitting upright and the female bowing as she calls. There may be mutual bowing, billing and fondling before the female flies to a perch where <span>coitus</span> occurs, usually taking place several times over the course of a few minutes. This owl usually nests on a cliff ledge, in a crevice, a gully or cave, but sometimes nests on the ground, between rocks or in some other concealed location. It often uses the same nest site year after year. Occasionally, it may take over a nest made by a large bird such as a <span>common raven</span> (<i>Corvus corax</i>) or <span>golden eagle</span>. Laying generally begins in late winter but may be later in the year in colder habitats. A single clutch of up to six white eggs is laid, each egg measuring 56-73mm x 44.2- 53mm (2.2- 2.9" x 1.7- 2.1") and weighing 75- 80 g (2.6- 2.8&#xA0;oz). The eggs are normally laid at intervals of three days and are incubated only by the female. The first egg hatches after 31 to 36 days. During the incubation period, the female is brought food at the nest by her mate.</p>
<p>The nestlings open their eyes at around two days old and continue to be brooded while the other eggs hatch. The female stays with her young at the nest for four to five weeks. For several weeks the male brings food to the nest or deposits it nearby, and the female feeds small pieces to the nestlings, or sometimes the male feeds the young directly. By three weeks, the female leaves the nest for longer periods and resumes hunting. At this period, the chicks are starting to feed themselves and begin to swallow smaller prey whole. At five weeks they can walk around the nesting area and at seven weeks are able to fly short distances. They leave ground-based nests at an earlier age than they do for aerial ones. Care of the young continues to be provide by both parents for around five months. The juveniles become independent between September and November in Europe, and leave their parents' territory. The young reach sexual maturity by the following year, but do not normally breed until they can establish a territory at around two or three years old.</p>
<p>The eagle owl can live for up to twenty years in the wild. However, like many other bird species in captivity they can live much longer without having to endure difficult natural conditions, and have possibly survived up to 60 years in zoo collections. Healthy adults normally have no natural predators and are thus considered <span>apex predators</span>, although they can be mobbed by a variety of smaller birds, including smaller <span>hawks</span> and <span>owls</span>. The leading causes of death for this species are man-made: electrocution, traffic accidents and shooting sometimes claim the eagle owl.</p>

<p>About a dozen <span>subspecies</span> are recognised: However the exact number is unclesr and they tend to <span>intergrade</span> where their ranges overlap. The <span>Pharaoh eagle-owl</span> (<i>Bubo ascalaphus</i>) was at one time considered to be a subspecies but has now been elevated to full species status.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>The European eagle owl has a very wide range across much of Europe and Asia, estimated to be about 32,000,000 square kilometres (12,000,000&#xA0;sq&#xA0;mi). In Europe there are estimated to be between 19,000 and 38,000 breeding pairs and in the whole world around 250,000 to 2,500,000 individual birds. The population trend is thought to be decreasing because of human persecution, but with such a large range and large total population, the <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> has rated the bird as being of "<span>least concern</span>".</p>
