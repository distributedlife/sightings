<p><b>Hodgson's bat</b> (<i>Myotis formosus</i>), also called the <b>copper-winged bat</b>, is a species of <span>vesper bat</span> in the genus <i>Myotis</i>, the <span>mouse-eared bats</span>. Favouring mountain forests, it is found throughout <span>Central</span>, <span>Southeast</span>, and <span>East Asia</span>, from Afghanistan to the Japanese island of <span>Tsushima</span>. It is about 5 centimetres (2.0&#xA0;in) long and is distinguished from most other species of bat in this range by its yellowish colouration.</p>
<p/>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>An adult Hodgson's bat has a head and body length of 4.3 to 5.7 centimetres (1.7 to 2.2&#xA0;in), a tail length of 3.6 to 5.6 centimetres (1.4 to 2.2&#xA0;in) and a wing length of 4.3 to 5.2 centimetres (1.7 to 2.0&#xA0;in) and weigh about 15 grams (0.53&#xA0;oz). The colouring of the short dense fur that covers its body is much more yellow than is that of other bats found within its range.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Distribution_and_habitat">Distribution and habitat</span></h2>
<p>Hodgson's bat is native to <span>Nangarhar Province</span> in Afghanistan, the <span>Sylhet Division</span> of Bangladesh, the Indian provinces of <span>Punjab</span>, <span>Jammu and Kashmir</span>, <span>Himachal Pradesh</span>, <span>Maharashtra</span>, <span>Meghalaya</span>, <span>Jharkhand</span>, <span>Sikkim</span>, <span>Uttarakhand</span>, <span>West Bengal</span>, <span>Bihar</span>, <span>Assam</span> and <span>Mizoram</span>, and the Central and Western parts of Nepal at altitudes up to about 3,000 metres (9,800&#xA0;ft). It is also known from eastern and central China, Taiwan and Korea, the Indonesian islands of <span>Sumatra</span>, <span>Java</span>, <span>Sulawesi</span> and <span>Bali</span>, and from the islands of <span>Palawan</span>, <span>Negros</span>, <span>Sibuyan</span> and <span>Luzon</span> in the Philippines. It is found in both upland and lowland primary and secondary forests and roosts in caves and trees, and sometimes buildings.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Behaviour">Behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Hodgson's bat is an <span>insectivore</span>, locating its insect <span>prey</span> by <span>echolocation</span> during flight and catching it on the wing. In Taiwan, breeding begins in March and peaks in May. Up to two hundred females congregate in an underground maternity colony and give birth during May and June. Prior to this, the bats spend an average of nine hours foraging at night, but this time is reduced after giving birth. Newborn young measure about 2.15 centimetres (0.85&#xA0;in) long and weigh about 3.7 grams (0.13&#xA0;oz). They remain in the roost while the mother forages and for the first week stay in their birth location. After that they begin to crawl around and by the third week are able to take short flights. The mother spends much time grooming the newly-born youngster but by the time it is two weeks old, she normally roosts away from it. Between mid-August and early October the bats leave the maternity cave and spend the winter in <span>hibernation</span> in caves elsewhere.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h2>
<p>Hodgson's bat has a wide range but is not a common species within that range. The population trend is unknown but it seems to be an adaptable species of bat and able to live in various habitat types. It faces no specific threats so the <span>IUCN</span> has assessed it as being of "<span>Least Concern</span>" in its <span>Red List of Threatened Species</span>.</p>
